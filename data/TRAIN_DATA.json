        "Physical renovation of office and storage space in the Office of Anthro- pology, and the administrative reorganization of the Office, have both necessitated and made possible extensive rearrangements and improve- ments in storage facilities and in procedures for processing, accessioning, and cataloging new specimens. The 5000 drawers of skeletal material were placed in an alphabetical arrangement of states and foreign countries, with a special placing of the Huntington collection of early 20th-century Americans (largely born abroad). This work was skill- fully supervised by Donald Ortner. The African collections were placed in a systematic, geographical arrangement, and within each major area many objects formerly arranged by type were rearranged by tribe. The Old World archeological collections were rearranged. And the Smithsonian's sizable collection of Japanese ceramics was classified according to geographic regions and to the kilns of Japan. Objects resulting from acculturation, whether made for export or for sophisticated local use, were placed apart from the traditional specimens. Rearrangement and reidentification of the Japanese ceramics were greatly facilitated by the assistance of Mr. and Mrs. Victor Hauge.",

        "A numismatic seminar consisting of eleven sessions was held by the division of numismatics from March 9 through May 18, 1967. Dr. and Mrs. Clain-Stefanelli developed the program as a survey of the science of numismatics and its aims, and it included a discussion of the most important numismatic references. Coins as documents of history and art in coinage formed the subject of two sessions. Two other sessions giving a survey of coining metals and of coining techniques provided the necessary basis for a presentation of special methods germane to numismatic research, such as the comparative study of dies in order to establish chronological sequences of coins. The application of scientific methods of investigation \u2014 particularly physics \u2014 in numismatics was the subject of another session. The concepts guiding the activity of numismatic museums throughout the world and a history of the Na- tional Numismatic Collections completed the series of seminars. In the review session, the curator emphasized the necessity for a continuous reappraisal of the scope of numismatics.",

This collection includes a virtually complete series of official issues of the United States and an unparalleled series of pioneer and territorial issues. The Latin American section is outstand- ing for its nearly complete series of Spanish colonial issues from Mexico, Peru, Chile, and Bolivia. Other numismatic rarities have been received from Mrs. Henry Norweb, Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer L. Neinken, Dr. Sidney A. Peerless, and, through their continued generosity, from Mr. Willis H. DuPont and members of the Stack family of New York. From the latter, the Department has received the original galvano model for Christian Gobrecht's famous \"defiant eagle\" design (circa 1838), the first known example of the use of electro deposition processes in coin manufacture in the United States.",

        "The Gallery's exhibition program focused primarily on the Bi- centennial with two extensive displays, \"In the Minds and Hearts of the People, 1760-1774\" and \"The Dye is Now Cast, 1774- 1776,\" each containing some 250 portraits and objects of other kinds. Full-scale catalogues (of 240 and 344 pages, respectively) accompanied each of these exhibitions, and materials specially in- tended for secondary school students were prepared by the Gallery's Education Department. The Gallery also mounted a special exhibition for the Archives of American Art entitled \"From Reliable Sources,\" consisting of letters, documents, and photo- graphs from the Archives' collections. The 761 St.-Memin portrait engravings given the Gallery last year by Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon were installed in a gallery permanently set aside for the collection. A number of small exhibitions were also mounted, in- cluding one on John Brown and two devoted to the centennials of the births of Herbert Hoover and Winston Churchill.",

        "Continuing its function as a Smithsonian resource facility, the office organized for the National Aeronautics and Space Admin- istration a one-week seminar on the \"Outlook for Space,\" designed to provide insight into the social-political-economic-cultural en- vironment foreseen for the remainder of this century, to assist in planning future space research and exploration. Some thirty guest discussants and twenty-five scientists and astronauts from nasa participated in the meetings at Hammersmith Farm, the summer estate of Mr. and Mrs. Hugh D. Auchincloss at Newport, Rhode Island. As a result of the seminar, the office has been approached by the Preservation Society of Newport County and other civic groups and leaders to advise on ways and means to take advantage educationally of the architectural resources of their community for seminar and symposium activities. For example, the office is assist- ing in the planning of a Bicentennial symposium on the history of religious toleration and freedom in the United States which will make use of Touro Synagogue, Trinity Church, and other historic structures as settings for scholarly dialogues.",
