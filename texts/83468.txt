THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION 



The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846 

 in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson of Eng- 

 land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of 

 America "to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith- 

 sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion 

 of knowledge among men." After receiving the property and accept- 

 ing the trust. Congress incorporated the Institution in an "establish- 

 ment," whose statutory members are the President, the Vice 

 President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive depart- 

 ments, and vested responsibility for administering the trust in the 

 Smithsonian Board of Regents.

A Decade of ''Increase and Diffusion" 



S. DILLON RIPLEY 



This is the tenth Annual Report of the Institution which I have had 

 the honor to prepare. In these years it has been a surcease to find how 

 stable the aspects of the Smithsonian have been which match the 

 needs of the people. "Increase and diffusion/' that tantalizing phrase, 

 continues to be our watchword. We attempt to adhere steadily to cer- 

 tain goals, and to eschew transitory fads. 



This past year in Washington has been one of a kind of misty sus- 

 pension, like the haze that hangs over the river bottom in the early 

 mornings spring and fall, in our famous marshes of reclaimed land, 

 known as 'Toggy Bottom." This curious state of suspense has been 

 somewhat akin to sitting in an operating theatre, although the sur- 

 geons were invisible and the body only faintly lighted in a penumbral 

 shade, waiting for the eclipse to go away. Day by day there were con- 

 flicting sounds, adumbrations which swirled about us through the 

 medium of the news. The shadows lengthened during the year as if 

 the operation was too long and the body might turn into a cadaver. 

 But later the pall eased, we breathed again, realizing that the patient 

 would recover, the body politic was alive after all. For in the process 

 we all survived. The surgery had not really been directed entirely to 

 any one person. It has been a kind of psychosurgery or mental vivi- 

 section directed at us all, and in the end we may have emerged better, 

 we hope, for the ordeal. From the Smithsonian towers we can docu- 

 ment the events, hopeful that in time we can present an objective vi- 

 sion of this segment of the history of our times for those who come to 

 see and learn from our "diffusion." 



In science the Smithsonian's research, our "increase," continues in 

 the study of the natural world about us, the objects of creation on the 

 land, the seas, and the phenomena they enclose; and the planets, the 




measuring of our Earth against them, the Sun and its effect upon us/j 

 and the steady tabulation of the phenomena of outer space. 



In history we continue with our encyclopaedic endeavors in the 

 history of American culture and the preservation of that history; 

 whether by conserving the objects or the processes of creation which 

 they represent. 



In art we continue to follow our mandate to preserve, collect, ex- 

 hibit, and encourage the study of American art, its roots in the rest of 

 the world, and its current evolution. With the present interest of our 

 government in sponsoring and supporting the arts and humanities, a 

 new partnership, in theme at least, begins to emerge. Although sepa- 

 rate, the Smithsonian maintains common interests and close ties withi 

 the National Endowments for the Arts and for the Humanities. Both 

 share common tasks, and both work together progressively through 

 the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities. This is especially 

 important in the forthcoming events of the Bicentennial years. In ad- 

 dition there is much to interest the Endowments in the new art mu- 

 seum opening on the Mall in October, 1974, and in the burgeoning; 

 studies in art and art history being undertaken by the various Smith- 

 sonian enterprises, as well as in the living Folk Festivals. What a, 

 celebration of the American Spirit these Endowments have become, 

 and how vital their part in encouraging American creativity as well as; 

 cultural history and research! 



All of which is to say that like the Endowments the Smithsonian is< 

 alive and well, whether in science or in art, and that each year its; 

 purposes and its services are becoming increasingly apparent and: 

 comprehensible to our people. As the Institution becomes more un- 

 derstood so the morale of its staff improves. We all realize the impor- 

 tance to our citizens of what we are doing, and this improves our own" 

 quality and our dedication. So be it. j 



As we become more important to people, our visitors increase, ouri 

 memberships in the Associates increase, our magazine and related^ 

 publications and benefits reach out further and further (our member-? 

 ships now are 622,000) and so our responsibilities to be true to ouri 

 goals and to increase and diffuse knowledge become more evident. 

 Our obligations to ourselves for standards and quality have not*' 

 changed, but these very traditions of ours become more visible. As;, 

 this happens, we pay a kind of penalty — that of being noticed. For 

 years I had thought many of the things that the Smithsonian just, 



4 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




went on doing quietly and competently were underappreciated and 

 in effect undervalued. Our knowledge about the environment of the 

 planet and our knowledge of the solar system seemed to me so com- 

 prehensive that I was disturbed that more people did not know about 

 all this, or that only those in cloistered circles were party to our work 

 and failed to noise it abroad. Now with our new exposure there is by 

 contrast a penalty to popularity. It is what I used to call "joining the 

 cold shower club." By becoming noticed one becomes the subject of 

 curiosity, sometimes the object of criticism, or even envy (if doing 

 things well). We are, I am sure, prepared to pay the penalty for con- 

 tinuing to do well what we are charged with doing, and to that we can 

 say, amen. 



Suffice it to affirm that we will continue to prepare to play host to 

 an increment of several million visitors a year who come in spite of 

 the obstacles of traffic, outmoded transportation, increasing costs, 

 and stultifying living and travel handicaps. And we will continue to 

 fight for their right to come in spite of obstacles placed in their way 

 by time and circumstance. For we know that it is in the interests of 

 the people and their increasing desire to know themselves that they 

 should come and see our Institution, and we know that in this we 

 Kave the support and the enthusiasm of the Congress who continue 

 to find the work of the Smithsonian refreshing.^ 



Last year I wrote a good deal about the Bicentennial and the Smith- 

 sonian's essential activities in the long-past Centennial of 1876, 

 Vleanwhile, sparked by the new administration under John Warner, 

 the 1976 Bicentennial approaches with every breath we breathe, and 

 bur own preparations for '76 wax apace. Our first major Portrait Gal- 

 ery exhibition has opened to critical acclaim. Our renovations of the 

 \rts and Industries Building have started in order to make it an evoc- 



\ 



^ Professor Wilcomb Washburn reminds me of a diary entry of Congressman 

 ienry L. Dawes of Massachusetts who came to Washington to serve in 1852, 

 ind speaks of the Institution — 



"The Smithsonian Institute is the noblest of all monuments ever erected in 

 he United States. Washington lives in the affections and reverence of his coun- 

 rymen justly before all others and the great monument going up to his memory 

 s in a corresponding degree an object of interest. (The Washington Monument 

 vas still under construction.) But the Institute is at once a monument and an 

 ingine of power, a fountain of knowledge, a bulwark for the preservation of 

 he liberties Washington bequeathed. It has been founded and is rising in grand 

 ofty proportions 'for the diffusion of knowledge among men.' And so long as 

 t shall fulfill its mission fears are idle — Man will be free." 



Statement hy the Secretary I 5 




ative setting of what the Centennial of 1876 was all about. Addition- 

 ally we are planning on a strong effort to accon^modate our visitors 

 with guidance, information, food, protection, and a sense of wel- 

 come and enthusiastic reception. i 



A whole series of things — exhibits, happenings, publications, tes- I 

 taments to human curiosity, and just plain fun — will be awaiting ; 

 them in 1976, not least of which will be an entire new museum dedi- i 

 cated to America's single and most salutary technological achieve- ; 

 ment, an achievement which has helped to expand and rework our ; 

 culture in all its ramifications, the conquest of air and space. Can | 

 there be any insentient people alive today in this country who do not 

 realize that the conquest of air, and now of space, has changed our 

 perspectives, our culture, indeed our ethos? In essence increasingly 

 rapid modes of flight have abolished time, pressed the concept of 

 communications close to human tolerance through the continuing 

 evolution of the computer, helped to abolish faith, and prepared us 

 for a new and as yet uncharted way of viewing the human condition. 



America, I hope, will be thinking of 2076 by the time the Bicenten- 

 nial comes along. And in that connection we might as well have a 

 look at the panorama showing how we reached our present predica- 

 ment. Our untrammeled will to succeed, to better our style of life 

 through our communication and transport, has put us where we are. 

 We could call our Air and Space Museum last year's Pandora's Box, 

 and looking in visualize what we had better do about next year's. For 

 we have not stopped the clock in the past, and if we are to slow it ; 

 down in the future we will have to realize what has been happening 

 to make so much of that future inevitable. In his recent (1974) short 

 book, Robert Heilbroner questions the continued hegemony of 

 organized science under the present threat of a new Dark Age for our \ 

 civilization. That we face the possibility of a new Dark Age in history 

 is evident to many. As an ecologist, I have found the recent discus- 1 

 sions of economists and social scientists on the subject of the inter- 

 dependence of population trends and the use of natural resources, | 

 agriculture, industrial growth, and pollution, a kind of coming home 

 to roost, neo-Malthusian thinking caught up with Volterra-Gause 

 hypotheses of strategies of competition in nature. Heilbroner believes 

 that science and technology have developed in an inimical manner to 

 foster runaway population, cataclysmic wars, and environmental 

 degradation without compensating restraints and standards, includ 



6 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




ing moral and ethical controls. He postulates that religion will and 

 must rise again to insure the reawakening of civilization itself. As 

 with a see-saw, he envisages science losing its paramountcy as reli- 

 gion arises once more. This to me is overly simplistic. An economist 

 can afford perhaps to be an agnostic, but most philosophically in- 

 clined scientists — physicists (who perforce must be philosophers), 

 molecular biologists, and the best of the ecologists — will tell you that 

 they hold to an essential faith in laws of creation, which are indeed 

 the moral and ethical presumption on which religion is based. What- 

 ever limits to creation we may have plumbed, it is a popular fiction 

 to assume that in the process scientists have destroyed our faith. 



All of which is not to say that it is not worthwhile to have men of 

 the caliber of Heilbroner, as social scientists, becoming aware of eco- 

 logical principles. Jan Tinbergen, winner of the Nobel prize in eco- 

 nomics, told me recently that he owed a great part of his somewhat 

 unorthodox theoretical assumptions to new insights he had gained 

 from his brother Nikolaas, a Nobel prize winner in biological medi- 

 cine, who is a pioneer in the study of the behavior of animals under 

 field conditions, away from laboratory controls, where they are 

 guided by and demonstrate ecological principles. It is sad that the 

 social sciences have classically paid so little attention to the broad 

 truths of ecology. 



In the past year we had the novel experience of the turning off of 

 the taps which supply our gasoline pumps, and Americans — repre- 

 senting six percent of the world's population but conditioned to 

 gobbling up nearly forty percent of the world's resources — are just 

 now beginning to get the message. Our massive indifference to in- 

 ternational bureaux and offices talking about one-world politics, eco- 

 nomics, and world interdependence has been conditioned over the 

 years by the perfect conviction that being an American is a natural 

 condition v 'hich we assume carries with it all the perquisites of tech- 

 nological superiority over our fellow inhabitants of the planet. No 

 matter that there are inequities in the United States itself — we know 

 that also — but what many citizens, temporarily enraged by such in- 

 equities, overlook is our commonly held assumption, all of us, that 

 the automobile and the open road, the shopping center, and the fan- 

 tastic and dazzling distribution of material goods at all levels is a 

 natural right. As Americans, either richer or poorer, we have it way 

 over eighty percent of the rest of the people of the world. 



Statement by the Secretary I 7 






Whether we deserve it all or not seldom gives us pause, although 

 last winter's threat of gas rationing was at least a temporary aberra- 

 tion in the hiatus between winter holidays and summer vacation. 

 Now that the gas taps have turned on again, it is easy to believe that 

 all's right with the world once more. It is easy to forget the unpleas- 

 antness of the spectre of declining resources. 



In this state of vague malaise the conviction has come to many 

 younger and also minority group members that the survival of the 

 Republic is uncertain. Whereas historians or political scientists glori- 

 fied the successes of America, based on the application of intelli- 

 gence, others such as Jean-Fran(;:ois Revel now describe what is hap- 

 pening in America as a revolution, which indeed it is. But we can take 

 heart in his definition of revolution, provided ethics survive, for in 

 the process we may approach a truer mode of life and an understand- 

 ing of what we are about. I have written before of what the Smith- [ 

 sonian could provide as a means of exhibiting this process of under- 

 standing. I feel it could be done in what I have called a Museum of 

 the Family of Man, a synthesis of thinking about man's place in the 

 universe. 



People in the United States have come full circle in their ideas. Two 

 generations ago and more the thought was that this new frontier, this 

 boundless Nation, would serve as a melting pot wherein all would 

 be remade into an indigenous American mold. Here all the nations 

 would provide of their best, most daring, and adventurous spirits, 

 who, in this heady atmosphere of opportunity, would become 

 blended into what de Tocqueville and others thought of as the new 

 American breed. 



The romantic spirit, descendant of the philosophical idealism of 

 the spirit of the revolutions, took no account of the remainder of the 

 native Americans, that remnant which thoughtful men at the time of 

 the Nation's Centennial had feared would have gone extinct by the 

 twentieth century. Nor were the blacks or Mexican-Americans con- 

 sidered. Eighty years later, by the 1930s, the Indian population was 

 recovering from its doldrums of the turn of the century, the Mexican 

 and Latin American minorities were increasing in the Southwest and 

 in the eastern urban centers, and the blacks — Raymond Pearl had 

 prophesied that the black population would disappear for genetic 

 reasons in two hundred years or so. Instead of homogenization we 

 now, approaching our Bicentennial, celebrate ethnic diversity and 



8 / Smithsotzian Year 1974 




cultural pluralism. Whether our blacks or other minority types with 

 recognizable physical features disappear or not is moot. Black is 

 beautiful and the liberated American today eschews the melting pot 

 and embraces the reawakened realization that traditions of old ways 

 persist in the New World, that song, dance, drama, the arts, lan- 

 guage — all the stuff of culture — continue to exist, to be perpetu- 

 ated in strongly persistent patterns. We cannot entirely forget our 

 cultural heritage even as a multiplicity of physical types remains 

 permanent in our midst. Perhaps then we have learned a lesson that 

 biologists of years ago would have been tempted to support, that 

 blending inheritance is far more rare than the persistence of basic 

 traits and types, and that cultural patterns mirror in their persever- 

 ance these physical verities. 



Under the circumstances, it is appropriate that the Smithsonian, 

 too, should come full circle. We can create a summing up of the 

 American experience, a synthesis of all that we have learned, the in- 

 teractions of man on this part of the planet, the interface between 

 ourselves and our environment. A Museum of the Family of Man 

 then would include certain demonstrable American themes, includ- 

 ing the history of the United States folk, who had come here, when 

 and how, and how this had changed the land and sea and air, its past 

 and present face. Hopefully, such an illumination of our times could 

 i include, with the aid of computer systems and current technology, an 

 i informed projection of our evolution, both physically and culturally, 

 into the future, our own "Brave New World." 



More importantly, as my colleague Under Secretary Brooks has 

 emphasized, such a museum must suggest the continuing process of 

 man's evolution as a creator. As he phrases it, "From all the testa- 

 ments of man's creativity, we can recognize at least two kinds of 

 multi-millennial chains of men and women who have created things, 

 technique^;, or concepts relating to the physical world. The first kind 

 is in its important phase pre-literate and inventive; it has evolved the 

 basic physical conditions of human society and survival — as for in- 

 stance the cultivation of grains, domestication of animals, shelter, 

 mobility, etc. The second kind of succession is post-literate and con- 

 ceptual; it has evolved understanding of the world, the universe, 

 man's own nature, and the structures of thought itself. The two have 

 common ground but different approaches to understanding, and de- 

 serve equal honor. They proceed in common from man's bio-psycho- 



Statement by the Secretary I 9 




logical heritage — his visual brain, manual dexterity, capacity for use 

 of symbols and language." 



To suggest the process means, of course, to avoid the static quality 

 of museums encompassed in arrays of finite objects, but rather to 

 formulate a kind of multimedia display, "engaging the viewer's own 

 processes of thought and imagination." The process is a speed-up 

 process too. From the unique fact that evolution provided the tools, 

 man's ability to communicate effectively, and the evolution of man- 

 ual dexterity, has come the unfolding of brain integration in these 

 functions. Each system has buffered and supported the other, devel- 

 oping an end product unlike any other known on the planet. Thus 

 the diverging into the two types of creativity: the technologies of sur- 

 vival and the evolution of thought. In this latter aspect of creativity 

 there are the social inventions: "elaborations upon the family, the 

 tribe, the state, the organs of justice, legislation, administration, 

 caste, class, trade, education, war." Then there is the invention of 

 social institutions, "and the creators who formulated social thought 

 and promoted social action." These historical creations are all rooted 

 in man's biological heritage as well, and of course have speeded up 

 enormously along with the evolution of technology. 



In any discussion of process it is instructive to speculate about the 

 possibility, achieved five years ago, of landing a man on the moon. 

 Although the technologies existed to create orbiting machines in 

 space, James Webb has pointed out to me that the human factor, the 

 men who could manipulate the machines effectively enough to land 

 themselves on the lunar surface, and then blast off again to join up 

 with their circling companion, must have been brought up from 

 childhood in an atmosphere where the commonplaces of advanced 

 technology all worked. Communication by telephone, for example, is 

 randomly so taken for granted in the U.S.A., because the telephones 

 work so relatively perfectly, that we are brought up and accustomed 

 to have perfect transmittal of ideas or mechanical concepts in using 

 them. We do not have to have meetings or conferences face to face. 

 Our generations of people are thus habituated for learning and the 

 transfer of vital information in a way that a considerable part of the 

 rest of the world's population is not, or has not been until very re- 

 cently indeed. Thus the time lags implicit in technological condition- 

 ing and familiarity make for different phased levels of assimilation 

 of the processes of learning. The chances, therefore, are that only 



10 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




one particular segment of peoples or culture may be capable of land- 

 ing on the moon at any one time. And I might add, at the risk of 

 sounding complacent or overweening, that even the prospect of a 

 perfect link-up in space as between the products of two cultures, our 

 own and the U.S.S.R.'s, may be more difficult because of the back- 

 ground and training of the participants than our global strategists 

 and politicians would wish. 



This is one example of a truism in contemplating the history of the 

 family of man. No one group or segment of man, through the biolog- 

 ical and physical phenomena of geographical isolation, is exactly like 

 any other at points in time, as well as through the panorama of his- 

 tory, thus horizontally as well as vertically in a diagrammatic sense. 

 No museums have ever entirely encompassed all of the philosophical 

 and moral and physical implications which have resulted in our com- 

 plex world. It is a new way of looking at a subject that goes back to 

 ideas expressed in the last century, vested in the creation of the 

 Musee de I'Homme in Paris in 1877. Unfortunately the Musee de 

 I'Homme was an anthropology museum, and as I have said else- 

 where,^ until very recently it had been thought, rather uncomfort- 

 ably, that anthropology, being a kind of biological discipline, should 

 concentrate on early man and the present so-called primitive races 

 of man, leaving Western civilization to the classicists and the stu- 

 dents of folk history and the decorative arts. This situation has now 

 begun to change. In Washington we are thinking of drawing from 

 everything that our museums, whether of natural history, history of 

 science, culture and technology, or art museums, are exhibiting, each 

 in its own way. We are concerned here with a new concept, a syn- 

 thesis of the whole family of man and how it got that way. 



Interestingly enough we are not alone in this idea. We claim no 

 hegemony, of course. At the 1974 meeting of the International Coun- 

 cil of Museums held in Copenhagen, Mme. Nelly Motrocilova of the 

 Academy in Moscow, speaking on June 3rd, announced that the 

 U.S.S.R. too was thinking of the creation of a Museum of Man. 

 Suffice it to say that we shall be threshing out this concept over the 

 next year or two with ourselves, our committees such as the Smith- 

 sonian Council, and individual colleagues, with the hope that eventu-

Statement by the Secretary 1 11 




ally we can present a plan to the Congress for a new kind of museum 

 which could somehow embody the dreams of their constituencies 

 across this land, the realization by people of the United States that 

 their strength lies in the strength of their origins, their diversity and 

 the pride, courage, and hope that this can and must give them. Let 

 there be no despair then but a reasoned pride, measured with cour- 

 age and tempered with the sobering responsibilities that such self- 

 knowledge brings. The soothsayers and necromancers of today 

 adjure the young to think of themselves first, to cultivate their id, to 

 think first of "happiness" in a subjective sense. They have forgotten, 

 and the young with them, that they are not alone, but that within 

 themselves rests all the history of man. 



The Institution's "increase," its research progress in history, the 

 arts, and the sciences, is listed in Smithsonian Year 1974. Suffice it 

 to say that both in astronomy and astrophysics, work under Director 

 George Field is taking form in programs of great promise, particu- 

 larly in regard to new observations of the Sun made during the flight 

 of the Orbiting Space Laboratory in the past year. Additionally, suc- 

 cessful research and construction proceeds in concert with the Uni- 

 versity of Arizona on the multiple-mirror telescope. In the National 

 Museum of Natural History a vigorous new array of exhibits is in 

 the planning stage under the direction of Dr. Porter Kier. Temperate 

 and tropical environmental studies are being vigorously pursued at 

 our stations in the United States as well as in Panama. 



In the latter, significant efforts to enhance the staff as well as the 

 inventory-taking capability of the stations should begin to narrow 

 the gap between what we know about the New World tropics and 

 what limits to tolerance they possess in the face of man's destructive 

 abilities. For in the vast New World tropics where, contrary to con- 

 ventional wisdom, perhaps only ten percent of the land is susceptible 

 to agriculture, there is precious little time to measure the norms of 

 the tropical environment. Human population pressure is seeing to 

 that, be it for better or worse. Few biologists could argue that any- 

 thing that is happening in the tropics today is for the better, but their 

 voices will not be heard in the tendentious political clamour of the 

 developing world. At the very least we hope that the data we gather 

 will serve as a guide to the essential diversity of the tropical environ- 

 ment and as an indicator for the future of the riches we seem about 

 to forsake so willfully. The recent remarks on May 29th by the new 



12 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




President of Venezuela, Carlos Andres Perez, concerning that coun- 

 try's proposed national policy on conservation of natural resources 

 are splendid, however. If Latin America, with some of the poorest 

 soils in the world, could heed President Perez' speech then biologists 

 could breathe easier. 



Finally in the realm of science, a great step forward this past year 

 has been the beginning of the National Zoo's breeding project and 

 reserve at Front Royal, Virginia. Here is a conservation project in a 

 superb setting, which we hope will become a model of its kind, with 

 room for cooperation with zoological societies all over the country. 



In history our staff has collected the Institution's first Pulitzer 

 prize in the person of Professor Daniel Boorstin and his third volume 

 on The Americans: The Democratic Experience. All of us can take 

 pride in the outstanding historicoliterate achievements of this fa- 

 mous historian, who has resumed work as a Senior Historian after 

 four busy years as Director of the National Museum of History and 

 Technology. In this latter capacity he has been succeeded by another 

 eminent historian. Professor Brooke Hindle, sometime Dean, Arts 

 and Sciences, University College, at New York University, and head 

 of that university's Department of History for many years. Mr. 

 Hindle is particularly an historian of science, and his coming is a 

 matter of great joy to all of us. 



In the Museum of History and Technology this year we have also 

 celebrated the creation of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Institute for 

 Historical Research — a center for studies in the origins of war and 

 peace, headed by Professor Forrest C. Pogue, one of the preeminent 

 military historians of our time. This is a splendid augury for the Na- 

 tional Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board and may well be its 

 most salient contribution to the preservation of military history. 



In the past year the Freer Gallery has celebrated its semicentennial 

 with three splendid exhibitions accompanied by internationally at- 

 tended symposia, as well as the publication of lucid and beautifully 

 illustrated catalogues, and with the awarding of three Freer medals. 

 No one could fail to be heartened by the renewed interest in Chinese, 

 Japanese, and Islamic art which these exhibitions underscored. Over 

 200 scholars and students attended the colloquia, which were in- 

 tensely interesting and of high scholarly caliber. A symptom of the 

 universal importance placed on art in Japan was a special visit during 

 his stay in Washington by Prime Minister K. Tanaka. 



Statement by the Secretary 1 13 




( 




The National Portrait Gallery continued its striking series of his- 

 torical exhibits with a splendid exhibition and accompanying histori- 

 cal resource document, a catalogue on the Black Presence in the 

 American Revolution. Once again the Portrait Gallery has charted a 

 new and authoritative course in untraveled seas. I believe it is ob- 

 vious by now to most historians that this technique of exhibition and 

 wholly definitive catalogues is a new and unsuspected teaching tool 

 to remind us, as I have said earlier, that within us all resides the 

 history of man. 



The National Collection of Fine Arts has continued its imaginative 

 program of exhibits, including a revealing one on the history of the 

 plastic arts in recent time in the Pacific Northwest. I personally was 

 much moved by the evidence from the paintings of the expression 

 via palette tonalities of the difference between living in Oregon and 

 in Washington. Even in abstracts or in interiors the painters were 

 reflecting a subtle neo-tradition not only of style but of color, evi- 

 dence of the mood and atmosphere, the light and color of the two 

 States. What reflections cannot be drawn on the origins of ethnicity, 

 of phenotypic differences, of cultural subspeciation in such 

 happenings? 



A delightful footnote to the history of American art was the ex- 

 hibition of the work of "Lilly Martin Spencer: The Joys of Senti- 

 ment," the catalogue of which contains a brilliant introduction by 

 Director Joshua Taylor. The ncfa's collection of American portrait 

 miniatures, one of the best in this country, was placed on permanent 

 exhibition through the generosity of the Trustees of the Merrill 

 Trust. A special gallery designated the "Doris M. Magowan Gallery 

 of Portrait Miniatures" will exhibit these portrait miniatures for the 

 first time.x 



The substantial completion of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculp- 

 ture Garden in this past year has signaled the arrival of the mam- 

 moth collections of art in Washington and their incipient debut in 

 their new public setting, an event long awaited. We anticipate for- 

 mally opening the museum on October 1, 1974. This museum should 

 help to illuminate Joseph Henry's theme that the Mall is indeed a 

 people's park, a place of delight for citizens. The gloomy myths 

 about the sacred sward and the hallowed ground were no more a 

 part of the original concept of the Republic than any other Victorian 



Statement by the Secretary I 15 




conceits. The Mall is for all of the citizens of the United States and 

 by no means a cemetery. 



In this past year an additional West Coast branch of the Archives 

 of American Art has been opened by our energetic director, WilHam 

 Woolfenden, and the Presidency has been assumed by Dr. Irving 

 Burton after three years of devoted work by Howard Lipman, who 

 now becomes President of the Board of the Whitney Museum of 

 American Art in New York. We are deeply grateful to all these able 

 workers in the collation of the history of American art. 



The Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design in 

 New York continues with its reconstruction plans for the Carnegie 

 Mansion, for which over $1 million has already been raised. Under 

 the energetic chairmanship of Lewis A. Lapham, who has succeeded 

 Thomas J. Watson, Jr., as Chairman of the National Associates 

 Board, a subcommittee has been formed to enlist the support of New 

 York members, residents, and their wives to complete the reconstruc- 

 tion of the site for our National Museum of Design. 



Nearer at home our management enterprises and our reexamina- 

 tion of our structure proceed apace. In any sensible organization 

 there must come periodic assessments of where one is and where one 

 is going. In the process of keeping track of our "fragmented parts 

 which make a whole," as Joshua Taylor has described us, we periodi- 

 cally check the pace of our development. Are we running ourselves 

 ragged with too many activities? Can we achieve the discipline to 

 confine ourselves to our stated goals before natural accumulations 

 run away with us? For in the sense of our museums and collections, 

 the Smithsonian is a growth industry. Perhaps museums are one of 

 the only legitimate growth industries left? I think we can manage to 

 stay the course by perceiving common themes that unite us intellec- 

 tually, and not simply approach efficient controls as an administra- 

 tive function. For in our hope to "increase and diffuse knowledge 

 among men" lies an ideal as well as a responsible charge. We monitor 

 the processes continually, firm in our determination to illuminate 

 that ideal. 



In the realm of "diffusion," this past year has seen the Smithson- 

 ian undertake a new series of television programs under the direction 

 of David Wolper, with sponsorship by the du Pont Company. The 

 first program on matters of Smithsonian interest is expected to be re- 



16 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




leased in November, 1974. In all of these enterprises with new at- 

 tempts to increase and diffuse knowledge an enormous amount of 

 credit is due to the staff of this Institution, which in its many ramifi- 

 cations continues its devotion and effective assistance to our cause at 

 all levels. 



As part of the Smithsonian Product Development program, re- 

 ports indicate that in addition to previously approved craft items, 

 there will be authentic reproductions of pewter, silver, and textiles, 

 all based on existing Smithsonian documentation. 



During the past year I have lost two of my friends. For the ten 

 years of my tenure I have had the perfect conviction of longevity, se- 

 cure in the belief that my three predecessors would be continually 

 available as counsellors and reminders of the continuity of our hopes 

 for the Institution. As I have noted in Smithsonian (November, 1973, 

 and February, 1974), Dr. Wetmore and I have lost our two col- 

 leagues. Dr. Leonard Carmichael, my predecessor as Secretary, on 

 September 16, 1973, and Dr. Charles G. Abbot, his immediate prede- 

 cessor as Secretary, on December 17, 1973. Together we had seemed 

 a continuous chain, reaching back in time to when the Republic itself 

 was less than a century old. They had helped and encouraged me to 

 celebrate our own Smithson bicentennial in 1965, the 200th Anniver- 

 sary of our Founder's birth, a noble occasion reminding us all of the 

 academic and intellectual links of institutions like our own around 

 the world. We mourn their passing and the loss of contact with the 

 past which always helps to prepare us for the premonitions of the 

 future.

Board of Regents 



The board of regents held three meetings in fiscal year 1974. The 

 autumn meeting, convened on September 21, 1973, was designated 

 The Leonard Carmichael Memorial Meeting in honor of Dr. Car- 

 michael, the seventh Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. As an 

 appropriate tribute to his memory, the Regents unanimously de- 

 clared that the auditorium of the National Museum of History and 

 Technology, constructed during his tenure, hereafter be known as 

 the Leonard Carmichael Auditorium. A ceremony dedicating the Au- 

 ditorium was held on January 21, 1974, presided over by the Chan- 

 cellor, accompanied by music and with tributes from Dr. John Har- 

 per, Rector of St. John's Church, Dr. Melvin Payne, President of the 

 National Geographic Society, and the Secretary. 



The new Chairman of the National Board of the Smithsonian As- 

 sociates, Mr. Lewis A. Lapham succeeding Mr. Thomas J. Watson, 

 Jr., was assured of enthusiastic support by the Regents, who en- 

 dorsed the concept that the Institutional Development Committee of 

 the National Board of the Smithsonian Associates undertake the 

 Cooper-Hewitt capital fund raising as its first effort. 



Dr. Fred L. Whipple, Director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical 

 Observatory from 1955 to 1973, retired in July, 1973, and is to con- 

 tinue his work as Senior Research Scientist. The Regents voted to 

 award him the Henry Medal in recognition of his important contri- 

 butions to the Institution. 



Mr. Gordon N. Ray, Chairman of the Smithsonian Council, who 

 was present, briefly reviewed the activities of the Council since its 

 inception, citing its membership, its considerations, and conclusions. 

 The Board of Regents thanked Mr. Ray for his efforts and conveyed 

 appreciation to the Council members for their interest and work in 

 behalf of the Institution. 



The appointment of James H. Billington as Director of the Wood- 

 row Wilson International Center for Scholars was announced. 



The death of Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post, a great benefactor 

 of the Smithsonian Institution, occurred on September 12, 1973. A 



Statement by the Secretary I 19 




Smithsonian Committee was organized to work with the representa- 

 tives of Mrs. Post's estate and foundation to facilitate an orderly 

 transfer of the property and collections bequeathed to the Smith- 

 sonian. 



Subsequently the Board of Regents, their wives, members of the 

 National Board of the Smithsonian Associates, and the Chairman 

 of the Smithsonian Council gathered for the presentation of the 

 James Smithson Benefactor Medallion to Thomas J. Watson, Jr., 

 for his important contributions to the Smithsonian Institution. 



The January 25, 1974, meeting of the Board of Regents was desig- 

 nated The Charles Greeley Abbot Memorial Meeting in tribute to 

 the Smithsonian Institution's fifth Secretary, whose death occurred 

 in December at the age of 101. Appropriately, the Radiation Biology 

 Laboratory will bear Dr. Abbot's name henceforward, since this as- 

 pect of the Institution's research owes its genesis, in 1929, to Dr. 

 Abbot. 



The meeting took place at the Fort Pierce Bureau of the Smith- 

 sonian Institution located at Fort Pierce, Florida, including the 

 Harbor Branch Laboratory, as well as the research barge and the RV 

 Johnson. Secretary Ripley explained the history of the Fort Pierce 

 Bureau, its programs, and its plans for the future. A tour of the facili- 

 ties included brief talks by staff members, a tour of the model shop, 

 inspection of the submersible, and a demonstration of the launch and 

 recovery of the submarine. 



It was with great reluctance that the Executive Committee ac- 

 cepted the decision of Crawford Creenewalt not to stand for reap- 

 pointment after serving for eighteen years as an outstanding and 

 distinguished Regent. 



The Regents accepted the Acee Blue Eagle collection of paintings 

 and artifacts in order to foster interest in and understanding of 

 American Indian art and culture. It will be housed in the Anthropo- 

 logical Archives of the Department of Anthropology of the National 

 Museum of Man. 



The Smithsonian was granted a permit by the General Services 

 Administration for use of the former Beef Cattle Experiment Station 

 at Front Royal, Virginia; the National Zoological Park plans initially 

 to utilize this reserve for a breeding project. 



The spring meeting of the Board was held in the Regents' Room of 

 the Smithsonian Building on May 14, 1974. A Nominating Commit- 



20 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




tee appointed by the Chancellor submitted its recomnnendation for a 

 new Citizen Regent and for reappointment of two other Citizen Re- 

 gents whose terms were to expire. Joint resolutions were recom- 

 mended to be introduced in the Congress for these appointments. 



The Board authorized acceptance of a Zeiss planetarium instru- 

 ment, a Bicentennial gift from the Federal Republic of Germany. 

 This will be installed in the National Air and Space Museum to simu- 

 late the wonders of space and is expected to be operating when the 

 Museum opens in July, 1976. The instrument is to be named in 

 honor of the late Albert Einstein. 



The Regents received the report of the second Smithsonian Priori- 

 ties Conference convened at the Belmont Conference Center on Feb- 

 ruary 19-21, 1974, which pointed out in detail the progress of Smith- 

 sonian programs in the past year, and recommended additional steps 

 to be taken in administration and management within the Institu- 

 tion. Coupled with this were copies of a new survey of buildings and 

 facilities owned or occupied by the Institution.

Smithsonian Year • 1974 

 FINANCIAL REPORT 



T. AMES WHEELER, TREASURER 



Continued sound progress was shown in Smithsonian finances in 

 fiscal year 1974. Thanks to increased federal support and further im- 

 provement in results of the Institution's own educational and reve- 

 nue-generating efforts, we were able to cope satisfactorily with the 

 large inflation-bred rise in costs of salaries, supplies, and services, 

 and, at the same time, to strengthen our current operating funds 

 position. 



Added federal appropriations enabled us to increase needed 

 museum protection and other support services and to step up prepa- 

 rations for our important 1976 Bicentennial commitments. These in- 

 cluded steady progress on construction and future exhibits for the 

 new National Air and Space Museum and a beginning on a major 

 long-term reconstruction of National Zoological Park facilities. An 

 additional $l-million gift from the donor of the collections permitted 

 completion of the construction of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculp- 

 ture Garden. Other gifts and grants for specific purposes funded a 

 wide variety of research and exhibit activities. 



There remains an urgent need for major outside contributions in 

 support of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and De- 

 sign and a large number of other specific projects. Also, the Institu- 

 tion's endowment funds — always far from adequate for an Institu- 

 tion of this size — experienced during the year a worrisome drop in 

 value. In other respects, however, Smithsonian finances can be said 

 to have improved substantially in fiscal year 1974. Full detail of these 

 results is provided below. 



23 




Overall Sources and Application of Financial Support 



The total financial support available to the Institution from all 

 sources is shown in Table 1. These figures do not include the finances 

 of the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the 

 Performing Arts, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for 

 Scholars, which are all related legislatively to the Smithsonian but 

 whose financial and administrative affairs are for the most part sepa- 

 rately managed under independent Boards of Trustees. 



Total funds for operating purposes rose to $82,681,000 in fiscal! 

 year 1974, an increase of $10,607,000 over the preceding year. Fed- 

 eral appropriations of $65,063,000 accounted for 7?>.7 percent of the 

 total, research grants and contracts 12.1 percent, and nonfederal in- 

 come 9.2 percent; this ratio of support was roughly the same in fiscal 

 year 1973. In addition. Congress provided $21,860,000 in construc- 

 tion funds for continuing work on the National Air and Space Mu- 

 seum, for repairs to other Smithsonian buildings, and for the Na- 

 tional Zoological Park, principally for "Lion Hill," a major beginning 

 on the long-term renovation plan of Zoo facilities. 



In Table 2, these revenues from all sources (excluding construction 

 funds and the Special Foreign Currency Program) and their applica- 

 tion to individual Smithsonian bureaus and activities are shown in 

 considerable detail, demonstrating the complexity of funding result- 

 ing from the variety of resources and the large number of diversified 

 services provided. 



TEDERAL OPERATING FUNDS 



Federal appropriations for operating purposes totaled $65,063,000 i 

 including $1,695,000 for the Smithsonian Science Information Ex- 

 change, a separately incorporated organization, and $4,500,000 for ; 

 the Special Foreign Currency Program (in the blocked currency of ■ 

 certain foreign countries). The Special Foreign Currency Program! 

 administers grants to United States universities and similar organi- ■; 

 zations for research studies in Egypt, India, Pakistan, Poland, Tu- 

 nisia, and Yugoslavia (see Table 3). This program included a special 

 $1,000,000 amount (to be renewed for three additional years) to al- 

 low United States participation in unesco's international campaign . 

 to preserve archeological monuments on the Island of Philae in 



Egypt.

Excluding these special-purpose appropriations for the Science In- 

 formation Exchange and the Foreign Currency Program, federal op- 

 erating funds amounted to $58,868,000. This is $7,235,000 more 

 than fiscal year 1973, but $4,180,000 (58 percent) of this substantial 

 increase is attributable solely to meeting the costs of federal pay 

 raises of various categories beyond the Institution's control. The bal- 

 ance of the increase, $3,055,000, went primarily to three high- 

 priority program objectives. These were (1) preparation of exhibits 

 and related work of the National Air and Space Museum scheduled 

 to open in its new building on the Mall on July 4, 1976; (2) develop- 

 ment of special Washington, D. C, and national Bicentennial activi- 

 ties; and (3) phased strengthening of supporting services such as 

 museum object conservation; reference and research libraries; auto- 

 matic data processing applications to research, collections, and 

 administrative activities; and buildings and facilities care and protec- 

 tion. Allocation of the appropriations for operating purposes (ex- 

 cluding the Foreign Currency Program) by broad activity areas over 

 the past several years is shown in Table 4. 



It may be of interest to note that in performance terms about $12.6 

 million of the fiscal year 1974 appropriation was spent on basic re- 

 search in art, history, and science; $4.2 million on the acquisition 

 and management of collections (only a few hundred thousand dollars 

 of this were available for the purchase of objects) ; $7.1 million for

FEDERAL CONSTRUCTION FUNDS 



(Construction funding in fiscal year 1974 amounted to $4,860,000, 

 rplus $17,000,000 to meet progress payments under the contract au- 

 :thority provided in the fiscal year 1973 Appropriation Act for the 

 construction of the National Air and Space Museum. The new ap- 

 rpropriatiori provided primarily for the construction of the exciting 

 mew lion and tiger exhibit at the National Zoological Park and fur- 

 ther planning efforts aimed at implementing the approved master 

 plan for the complete renovation of the Zoo. This funding also pro- 

 > vided relatively minor amounts for repairs and improvements to 

 other Smithsonian facilities such as safety and access improvements 

 to the Mount Hopkins Observatory road in Arizona. 



Financial Report I 29 




GRANTS AND CONTRACTS 



Grants and contracts from federal agencies once again contributed in 

 a major way to the Institution's research programs, predominantly 

 in scientific disciplines. $9,996,000 of these funds was expended in 

 fiscal year 1974, up from $8,996,000 in fiscal year 1973. The major 

 recipient, accounting for over half of the total expenditures, con- 

 tinued to be the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cam- 

 bridge, Massachusetts, with grants from the National Aeronautics 

 and Space Administration for such projects as the monitoring of 

 Comet Kahoutek, meteor studies, and design of hydrogen maser 

 systems. Other projects ranged from ecological studies in South 

 America and Asia to research on American folklore. Table 5 shows 

 the major granting agencies to the Smithsonian over a four-year 

 period, representing several hundred different grants and contracts 

 each year. 



PRIVATE TRUST FUNDS 



Originally established entirely with funds from Mr. Smithson's be- 

 quest, the Institution has, over a long period of years, derived an in- 

 creasing proportion of its support from federal appropriations as it 

 was entrusted with more national collections and expanded its re- 

 search and public exhibitions. 



It is now an important goal of Smithsonian administration to bol- 

 ster the Institution's private resources in line with or exceeding the 

 growth of its federal support, in order to restore a better balance be- 

 tween the two, thereby helping to preserve its uniquely flexible and 

 independent character among national establishments. Despite the 

 many serious economic uncertainties of this past 12-month period, 

 fiscal year 1974 results were in line with this goal. Receipts (includ- 

 ing those for operating purposes, land acquisition, and building con- 

 struction) from gifts, investment income, revenue-producing activi- 

 ties, fees, and other revenues all increased to record levels, with the 

 total equaling $8,954,000 (not including $105,000 gifts to endow- 

 ment funds). Of this total $5,598,000 was designated for specific 

 restricted purposes; this latter amount was fractionally higher than 

 in fiscal year 1973, while income for unrestricted purposes rose from , 

 $1,013,000 to $3,356,000 (see Table 6). J

UNRESTRICTED PRIVATE FUNDS 



The substantial increase in unrestricted general purpose private 

 funds in fiscal year 1974 was extremely welcome and enabled the 

 Institution for the first time to reserve private monies for plant im- 

 provements not believed to be obtainable from federal appropria- 

 tions but which will enhance our ability to serve the public and 

 which may, at the same time, lead to increased private support in the 

 years ahead. The build-up of the general unrestricted fund balance 

 to a more adequate level of $3,067,000 also means that portions of 

 any similar gains in future years may also be used for this purpose 

 or to strengthen our present low endowment reserves. 



As may be seen in Table 7, the increase in income before transfers 

 to other funds, equaling $2,336,000 in fiscal year 1974 compared to 

 $688,000 in fiscal year 1973, arose in part from a jump in investment 

 income but, more importantly, from successful results of our educa- 

 tional and revenue-producing activities. There was, at the same time, 

 a somewhat offsetting rise in administrative costs, partly from salary 

 and other administrative cost increases (including an initial charge 

 of $198,000 to establish a reserve for employees' accrued annual 

 leave), but also reflecting greater assistance to a number of bureaus 

 for special needs and urgent research projects. 



The increase in investment income this year resulted primarily 

 from the build-up in working capital and advance Smithsonian mag- 

 azine subscription monies which made more funds available for in- 

 vestment in high quality short-term issues at prevailing high interest 

 rates. As may be noted on the Balance Sheet, page 48, current fund 

 investments equaled $8,298,000 as of June 30, 1974, compared to 

 $6,223,000 a year earlier; of the former amount, $6,600,000 was 

 invested in very high grade, short-term securities and bank certifi- 

 cates of deposit. 



The Smithsonian magazine was responsible for the largest share 

 of the net gain from revenue-producing activities. As shown in Table 

 8, its income for the year rose to $1,327,000, from $330,000 in the 

 previous year. At June 30, 1974, there were 622,000 National Asso- 

 ciate members and subscribers to the magazine, making it one of the 

 fastest growing publications in the Nation. The Associates program 

 also contributed heavily to this year's gains, with net income of 

 $263,000, versus a slight loss in fiscal year 1973. The Resident Asso-

 *** This includes allocations to the Press and other Smithsonian bureaus participating in this pro- 

 gram. 



The profitability of the Museum Shops also increased dramati- 

 cally, from $47,000 in fiscal 1973 to $226,000 in fiscal 1974, due in 

 large measure to improved management practices and increased em- 

 phasis on higher quality merchandise relevant to the collections ex- 

 hibited in the various Smithsonian museums. As with the Product 

 Development Program, which transferred $33,000 of royalities to in- 

 dividual bureaus, income from the Museum Shops will in the future 

 be shared with the museums for their use in public education pro- 

 grams and purchases for the cpllections. 



The Performing Arts Division produced an extremely successful 

 record album, the History of Jazz, which enabled them to show a 

 gain of $104,000 in this fiscal year, as opposed to a deficit of $65,000 



34 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




in fiscal year 1973. Another "bestseller" was the guidebook. Seeing 

 the Smithsonian, developed by the Smithsonian Press and Product 

 Development Offices in cooperation with the cbs Publishing Com- 

 pany; its sales added substantially to the profitability of the Museum 

 Shops. 



As any surplus funds accrue from project receipts of the shops or 

 the Associates program an appropriate effort is made to return this 

 in kind to the public in the form of improved public facilities, im- 

 proved public reference books or publications, and improved public 

 exhibits. As an example, the unusually large net gain in unrestricted 

 private funds in fiscal year 1974 coincided with urgent requirements 

 for construction funds, necessitating transfers of $1,134,000 to the 

 Institution's plant funds, with other transfers to Special Purpose 

 funds. Restricted Funds, and Endowment Funds bringing total trans- 

 fers to $1,561,000 (see Table 7). Of the transfers to plant funds, 

 $365,000 was set aside to redesign and reconstruct the museum shop 

 in the National Museum of History and Technology. Another $500,- 

 000 was reserved for a part of the costs of the proposed construction 

 of additional public service facilities in the West Court of the Na- 

 tional Museum of Natural History. Finally, $150,000 was transferred 

 to cover a part of the cost of a visitor's study center at the Chesa- 

 peake Bay Center for Environmental Studies, and $119,000 was 

 transferred for computer and equipment purchases. Other transfers 

 from unrestricted funds include allocations toward operations of the 

 Cooper-Hewitt Museum ($178,000), special research grants to 

 Smithsonian scientists ($49,000), and transfers to Endowment 

 ($121,000) which includes a bequest of $100,000 from the estate of 

 Paula Lambert. 



A new category of unrestricted private funds ("Special Purpose") 

 is set out separately this year, namely, those which are legally un- 

 restricted but which have been designated by management to be re- 

 served for specific uses (see Table 6). These accounts, previously 

 treated as a part of Restricted Funds, include, for example, receipts 

 from parking at the Zoo (reserved to aid future construction of addi- 

 tional parking facilities for visitors), and revenues from various 

 minor enterprises in individual museums (e.g., charges for tour- 

 guide audiophone equipment, etc.) and related expenditures of these 

 monies, chiefly for improvement of exhibits. As of June 30, 1974, 

 balances of these funds totaled $460,000, an increase of $259,000 in 

 the year. 



Financial Report I 35 




The Restricted Private Funds of the Institution, which support a 

 wide variety of activities even beyond the major ones highUghted in 

 Table 9, received $4,266,000 for operating purposes in fiscal year 

 1974. The Freer Gallery of Art and the Fort Pierce Bureau depend 

 primarily on income from their endowment funds, while the Cooper- 

 Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design and the Archives of 

 American Art, although receiving some federal support, must look 

 to gifts, grants, memberships, and various money-raising efforts for 

 their principal operating funds. In addition, it was necessary to 

 transfer $178,000 of private unrestricted funds to Cooper-Hewitt in 

 fiscal year 1974 to eliminate operating deficits accumulated over this 

 and previous years. 



In September 1973, at the death of Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather 

 Post, the responsibility for her "Hillwood" estate and the extraordi- 

 nary collections it contains passed to the Smithsonian. A trust fund 



36 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




was provided by her will for the maintenance and operation of Hill- 

 wood, but the estate had not yet been settled at year-end; part-year 

 income and expenditures for this new project are reflected in the Re- 

 stricted Private Funds table. 



The National Museum of History and Technology is conducting a 

 fund-raising campaign, with strong support from industry, to enable 

 creation of a new exhibit "Hall of American Maritime Enterprise" 

 devoted to national marine history. As of June 30, 1974, $166,000 

 had been raised with additional pledges received of over $100,000. 



A gift of $1 million was received from Joseph H. Hirshhorn in 

 fiscal year 1974 to be used to complete construction of the Hirshhorn 

 Museum and Sculpture Garden, due to open to the public in October 

 1974. This gift is reflected in the restricted gifts total in Table 6 in 

 the category of Plant Funds along with other gifts and miscellaneous 

 revenues for the new Chesapeake Bay Center building ($70,000) and 

 renovation of the Carnegie Mansion for the Cooper-Hewitt Museum 

 ($262,000). 



ENDOWMENT FUNDS 



The Smithsonian endowment includes three separate investment 

 funds: the Freer Fund, whose income is used solely by the Freer Gal- 

 lery of Art; Endowment Fund No. 3, which supports oceanographic 

 research at the Fort Pierce Bureau in Florida; and the Consolidated 

 Fund, which is an investment pool of all other Smithsonian restricted 

 and unrestricted endowment funds, although distinct administration 

 and accounting is maintained on each individual fund. Changes in 

 market values of these funds since 1970, reflecting additions from 

 donations and reinvestment of income, limited withdrawals, and 

 changes in securities valuations are shown in Table 10.

As detailed in previous Smithsonian Annual Reports, the invest- 

 ment of these three endowments is managed by three professional 

 advisory firms, under the close supervision of the Investment Policy 

 Committee and the Treasurer, and subject to policy guidelines set by 

 the Smithsonian's Board of Regents. Under the Total Return policy, 

 adopted for all funds by the Board of Regents in 1972, the income 

 to be paid each fund in the subsequent fiscal year is determined each 

 March 31 by computing 4V2 percent of the running five-year average 

 of market values. By selecting a fixed rate of return, regardless of 

 what the actual yield may be, the investment advisors are free to 

 choose the most attractive securities without being limited by the 

 need to achieve a specified dividend and interest income level and 

 at the same time Smithsonian budgeting procedures are simplified.

As shown in Table 11, the market values of the endowment funds 

 suffered badly in fiscal year 1974, sharing fully in the general stock 

 market decline. This fall in market values will have the effect in fiscal 

 year 1975 of reducing the Total Return income to the Freer and Con- 

 solidated Funds to somewhat below the level of fiscal year 1974, al- 

 though still higher than prior years.

Gifts, bequests, and reinvestment of income in certain restricted 

 funds added $297,000 to the Consolidated Fund, and a transfer of 

 $300,000 was made from Endowment Fund No. 3 to permit comple- 

 tion of the RV Johnson submarine tender as well as to cover costs 

 relating to the entrapment of the submersible Johnson-Sea-Link in 

 June 1973. Income totaling $1,948,000, net of managers' fees, was 

 paid out under the Total Return policy described above; this was 

 $355,000 in excess of dividend and interest yield on these Endow- 

 ment Funds in the year. Market valuations and income of the indi- 

 vidual restricted funds participating in the Consolidated pool are 

 shown in Table 12, and detail on the funds by types of securities held 

 is given in Table 13. A listing of the individual investments held in 

 the various endowment funds at June 30, 1974, may be obtained 

 upon request to the Treasurer of the Institution. 



Accounting and Auditing 



The Private Trust Funds of the Institution, as well as the accounts of 

 Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc., the Smithsonian 

 Research Foundation, and Reading-Is-Fundamental, Inc., are audited 

 annually by independent public accountants. Their report for fiscal 

 year 1974 on the Smithsonian is contained in the following pages, 

 including a comparative balance sheet and a statement of changes in 

 the various fund balances. Extensive changes in accounting treat- 

 ment of a number of items in accordance with new guidelines estab- 

 lished by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 

 have been referred to at length in the Notes to these statements and 

 are reflected in the tables in this report dealing with Unrestricted and 

 Restricted Private Funds. 



The Defense Contract Audit Agency annually performs an audit 

 on grant and contract monies received from federal agencies. In addi- 

 tion, the federally appropriated funds of the Institution are subject 

 to audit by the General Accounting Office. The internal audit staff 

 continues to conduct audits throughout the wide range of Smith- 

 sonian activities and contributes greatly to smooth administrative 

 and financial management.

The Board of Regents 

 Smithsonian Institution: 



We have examined the balance sheet of the Private Funds of Smith- 

 sonian Institution as of June 30, 1974 and the related statement of 

 changes in fund balances for the year then ended. Such statements 

 do not include the accounts of the National Gallery of Art, the John 

 F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, nor other departments, 

 bureaus and operations administered by the Institution under Fed- 

 eral appropriations as detailed in note 3 to the financial statements. 

 Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted 

 auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the ac- 

 counting records and such other auditing procedures as we consid- 

 ered necessary in the circumstances. 



In our opinion, the aforementioned financial statements present 

 fairly the financial position of the Private Funds of Smithsonian 

 Institution at June 30, 1974 and the changes in its fund balances for 

 the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted account- 

 ing principles which, except for the changes referred to in note la 

 to the financial statements, with which we concur, have been applied 

 on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

Current funds used to finance the acquisition of plant assets and for pro- 

 visions for debt amortization and interest are accounted for as transfers 

 to the plant fund. 



Fund Accounting — In order to ensure observance of limitations and re- 

 strictions placed on the use of the resources available to the Institution, 

 the accounts of the Institution are maintained in accordance with the prin- 



52 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




ciples of "fund accounting". This is the procedure by which resources for 

 various purposes are classified for accounting and reporting purposes into 

 funds that are in accordance with activities or objectives specified. Separate 

 accounts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accompanying 

 financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been com- 

 bined into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial transactions have been 

 recorded and reported by fund group. 



Within each fund group, fund balances restricted by outside sources are so 

 indicated and are distinguished from unrestricted funds allocated to spe- 

 cific purposes by action of the governing board. Externally restricted funds 

 may only be utilized in accordance with the purposes established by the 

 source of such funds and are in contrast with unrestricted funds over which 

 the governing board retains full control to use in achieving any of its 

 institutional purposes. 



Endowment funds are subject to the restrictions of gift instruments requir- 

 ing in perpetuity that the principal be invested and the income only be 

 utilized. Also classified as endowment funds are gifts which will allow the 

 expenditure of principal but only under certain specified conditions. 



Unrestricted quasi-endowment funds have been established by the govern- 

 ing board for the same purposes as endowment funds, any portion of such 

 funds may be expended. Restricted quasi-endowment funds represent giftt 

 for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the principal be 

 maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the governing board 

 has elected to invest the principal and expend only the income for the pur- 

 pose stipulated by the donor. 



All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection, or other disposition 

 of investments and other noncash assets are accounted for in the fund 

 which owned such assets. Ordinary income derived from investments, re- 

 ceivables, and the like, is accounted for in the fund owning such assets, 

 except for income derived from investments of endowment and similar 

 funds, which income is accounted for in the fund to which it is restricted 

 or, if unrestricted, as revenues in unrestricted current funds. 



All other unrestricted revenue is accounted for in the unrestricted current 

 fund. Restricted gifts, grants, endowment income, and other restricted re- 

 sources are accounted for in the appropriate restricted funds. 



c. Investments are recorded at cost or fair market value at date of acquisition 

 when acquired by gift. 



d. Inventories are carried at lower of average cost or net realizable value. 



e. Income and expenses in respect to the Institution's magazine and associates' 

 activities are deferred and taken into income and expense over the appli- 

 cable periods and are reported in the activities section of the current 

 unrestricted funds. 



f. Endowment and Similar Fund Investments — The Institution utilizes the 

 "total return" approach to investment management of endowment funds 

 and quasi-endowment funds. Under this approach, the total investment 

 return is considered to include realized and unrealized gains and losses in 

 addition to interest and dividends. In applying this approach, it is the Insti- 

 tution's policy to provide 4V2% of the five year average of the market value 

 of each fund (adjusted for gifts and transfers during this period) as being 

 available for current expenditures; however, where the market value of 

 the assets of any fund is less than 110% of the historic dollar value (value 

 of gifts at date of donation) the amount provided is limited to only interest 

 and dividends received. 



Financial Report I 53 




g. Plant Fund Assets — Plant fund assets are recorded as follows: 



Museum shop and computer equipment purchased with Private Funds is 

 capitalized in the plant fund at cost, and is depreciated on a straight-line 

 basis over an estimated useful life of five years. 



Real estate (land and buildings) are recorded in the plant fund at cost, 

 to the extent that restricted or unrestricted funds were expended therefor, 

 or appraised value at date of gift, except for gifts of certain islands in 

 Chesapeake Bay, Carnegie Mansion, and Hillwood Estate which have 

 been recorded at nominal values. Depreciation on buildings is not re- 

 corded. 



All the other land and buildings (principally acquired with Federal funds), 

 fixtures, equipment, works of art, living or other specimens are not re- 

 flected in the accompanying financial statements. 



Funds, previously recorded in the current funds group, whose purpose is 

 for construction and acquisition of plant assets, have been reclassified to 

 plant funds. 



h. Agency Funds — The agency funds group consists of funds held by the 

 Institution as custodian or fiscal agent for others. 



i. Pension Costs — All pension costs are funded as accrued.

the value per unit at market value at the beginning of the calendar quarter 

 within which the transaction takes place. Of the total units each having a 

 market value of $84.60 ($105.22 in 1973), 67,856 units were owned by en- 

 dowment, and 52,665 units by quasi-endowment at June 30, 1974. 



3. Related Activities 



Federal appropriations, which are not reflected in the accompanying finan- 

 ' cial statements, provide major support for the operations and administration 

 of the educational and research programs of the Institution's many mu- 

 seums, art galleries and other bureaus, as well as for the maintenance and 

 construction of related buildings and facilities. In addition, land, buildings 

 and other assets acquired with Federal funds are not reflected in the accom- 

 panying financial statements. 



The following Federal appropriations were received by the Institution for 

 the fiscal year ended June 30, 1974 : 



Operating funds $60,562,900 



Special foreign currency program 4,500,000 



Construction funds 21,860,000 



$86,922,900 



4. Note Payable 



The note payable in the principal amount of $191,843 ($295,761 in 1973) 

 which is non-interest bearing, is secured by computer equipment and is 

 payable in monthly installments of $7,993 to June 30, 1976. 



5. Mortgage Notes Payable 



The mortgage notes payable are secured by first deeds of trust on property 

 acquired in connection with the Chesapeake Bay Center. The details of the 

 mortgage notes payable are as follows: 



June 30, 



1974 1973 



Mortgage note, payable in semi-annual installments 

 of $13,300, plus interest at the prevailing prime 

 rate at the due date of the installment payment 

 but not less than 8%, due July 1, 1980 $172,900 199,500 



6% mortgage note payable, due in monthly install- 

 ments of $451 including interest, due November 1, 

 1989 36,717 33,034

7% mortgage note, payable in annual installments 



of $30,000, plus interest, due November 1, 1974 30,000 60,000 



$349,617 432,534 



6. Pension Plan 



The Institution has a contributory pension plan providing for the purchase 

 of retirement annuity contracts for all employees meeting certain age and 

 length of service requirements. Under terms of the plan, the Institution 

 contributes the amount necessary to bring the total contribution to 12% of 

 the participants' compensation subject to social security taxes and to 17% 

 of the participants' compensation in excess of that amount. The total pen- 

 sion expense for the year was $729,068 ($688,782 in 1973).

Smithsonian Year • 1974 



SCIENCE 



The past year in Science was characterized by a steady progress 

 toward the goals outhned at the first institutional priorities confer- 

 ence at Belmont in 1973. In addition, efforts were directed to re- 

 appraising and redefining certain management structures in order to 

 find new and better methods to build on to traditional strengths. 

 This effort is in line with the discussions resulting from the Institu- 

 tion's second priorities conference last February. 



The Museum of Natural History focused attention this past year 

 on its educational role, exploring new avenues to enrich the visitors' 

 experience. The formation of an in-house exhibits committee was a 

 first step in the Museum's desire to seek new directions in exhibitry. 

 The opening of the Touch Exhibit focused the public's attention on 

 alternate methods to the traditional museum experience. 



The National Zoological Park obtained a permit to the former 

 Army Remount Station at Front Royal, Virginia, for use as a breed- 

 ing farm, especially for endangered species. The new facility, it is 

 hoped, will allow for increased propagation of rare animals, away 

 from the limited space of Rock Creek Park. 



Early in the fiscal year, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observa- 

 tory joined with the Harvard College Observatory to form the Cen- 

 ter for Astrophysics. The new arrangement has led to more flexibility 

 in personnel and programs, increasing joint resources for maximum 

 use. 



The Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies continued 

 to progress toward a goal of increased educational opportunities for 

 neighboring schools and disadvantaged urban youth. A new build- 

 ing, which will house the educational and visitor orientation activi- 

 ties, was planned and bids were received for the work. The new 



I 



57 




building will release office and lab space now jointly used for re- 

 search and educational activities. Another program undertaken was 

 the Information Transfer Program which translates scientific results 

 into forms that can be useful to planners and government officials. 

 Money for this program was made available from the Edward John 

 Noble Foundation. 



The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (stri) underwent 

 a change of directorship this past year with the return of Dr. Martin 

 Moynihan to his research as Senior Scientist at stri. He was suc- 

 ceeded by Dr. Ira Rubinoff, who previously served as Assistant 

 Director at the facility. The research undertaken at stri continued 

 to be primarily concerned with basic scientific questions of the evo- 

 lutionary and ecological adaptations of tropical organisms. An in- 

 creased education program was undertaken with grants received 

 from the Henry L. and Grace Doherty and Edward John Noble 

 foundations. 



The National Air and Space Museum's new building continued on 

 schedule and within the budget began to rise and take form on the 

 Mall this past year with much of the staff's time being spent on the 

 preparation of exhibits that will be displayed in the new quarters. 

 The formation of the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies in the 

 Museum provides the basis for a scientific research arm in lunar 

 studies. 



The Office of International and Environmental Programs was es- 

 tablished this past year combining the Offices of International 

 Activities and Environmental Sciences. The new Office is designed 

 to further increase opportunities for the Smithsonian to conduct re- 

 search abroad in its traditional strengths in collection-based natural 

 history to the comparatively new area of environmental studies. 

 Wymberley Coerr, a career foreign service officer who served as 

 Ambassador to Ecuador and Uruguay, was appointed to head the 

 Office. 



In the past year, Smithsonian support of conservation in the Gala- 

 pagos Islands has increased substantially in response to a significant 

 rise in the number of contributions earmarked for Galapagos work. 

 Aided by the Research Station's new director, Craig MacFarland, 

 administration and equipment have been markedly strengthened, 

 and research expanded to include a marine biological survey, to help 

 determine the limits of the National Park. In addition, two Smith- 



58 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




sonian research teams have recently visited the islands, one to con- 

 tinue studies of volcanic activity of Isla Fernandina and the other to 

 begin a study of finches and orb-weaving arachnids. Educational 

 programs in the islands were augmented by the Smithsonian helping 

 to fund a volunteer from the Catholic Institute for International Re- 

 lations, who is teaching biology, natural history, and conservation 

 as well as aiding in the marine survey. Additionally, a Sl-Peace 

 Corps volunteer is working on the design of exhibits to the new 

 Van-Straelen musuem/lecture hall, which will provide natural his- 

 tory instruction for both tourists and Galapaguefios. 



The Smithsonian once again played a significant role in national 

 and international affairs. Smithsonian scientists and administrators 

 provided representatives and advisory services to the Council on 

 Environmental Quality, the Department of the Interior, the Institute 

 of Ecology, the First International Congress of Systematic and Evo- 

 lutionary Biology, the Asia Society, the Bahamas National Trust, and 

 the World Wildlife Fund. The staff has traveled to diverse places in 

 the United States and abroad including the Bahamas, the United 

 Kingdom, Switzerland, India, and Nepal. Smithsonian scientists con- 

 tinued their fruitful collaboration with foreign institutions on every 

 continent and provided technical assistance on environmental 

 programs. 



Details of these concerns and scientific accomplishments in other 

 areas of research by the individual bureaus, in fiscal year 1974, 

 follow. 



Center for the Study of Man 



Over the past year the Center for the Study of Man has expanded 

 and sharpened its research activities in the human sciences. From 

 August 26 to September 2, 1973, three conferences organized by the 

 Center were held in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Two more conferences 

 were held during the same period at Chicago, Illinois. Immediately 

 following these meetings each of the conferences reported its find- 

 ings to the assembled attendees at the IXth International Congress 

 of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences meeting in Chicago, 

 Illinois, from September 3 to 10. The 5 sessions organized by the 



Science I 59 




Center for the Study of Man were: (1) cross-cultural uses of can- 

 nibus; (2) cross-cultural uses of alcohol; (3) examination of a gen- 

 eral theory of cultural transmission; (4) cultural consequences of 

 population change; and (5) economic development in seven selected 

 American Indian groups. Each of these research projects was an out- 

 come of the Center's program to relate anthropology and the human 

 sciences to modern worldwide problems. All reports are now in one 

 or another stage of preparation for publication. 



Specifically, the cannibus report is in press, and it constitutes the 

 first well-documented report of cannibus usage on a worldwide 

 basis. The coverage is not complete, but it constitutes a beginning 

 and lays the groundwork for an accelerated growth of knowledge 

 in the immediate future. The papers in the alcohol volume, also in j 

 press, testify to the increasing worldwide sophistication of human j 

 scientists about alcohol usage and its perception in cultures around 

 the world. The general theory of cultural transmission considers 

 education as a special case. Because Western-style formal education 

 is so pervasive, it is especially important to learn more about other 

 perspectives on cultural transmission. The results of the conference 

 on population are in press, but the project is not yet complete. A 

 number of participants from developing countries met in Bucharest, 

 Rumania, in August to go over papers that have come out of the j 

 Oshkosh and Chicago meetings. The American Indian economic de- 

 velopment study is in press and should appear within a year. 



Manuscripts for the forthcoming encyclopedic Handbook of 

 North American Indians continue to arrive daily. The editorial office, 

 with the assistance of volume editors in various parts of the country, 

 is editing these works for publication in 1976. 



The Research Institute on Immigration and Ethnic Studies, under 

 the direction of Dr. Roy Bryce-Laporte, has been supervising re- 

 search in Costa Rica and Panama. In particular, it has focused on the 

 West Indian adaptation and experience in both of these countries. 

 It has also been reviewing policy implications of migration and 

 some contemporary perspectives on alienation. 



In June 1974, a National Anthropological Film Center was estab- 

 lished within the Center for the Study of Man. It is charged with the 

 preservation and study of" visual information on vanishing and 

 changing ways of life. 



60 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies 



The three programs of the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environ- 

 mental Studies — scientific research, information transfer, and en- 

 vironmental education — were marked by expansion and innovation 

 during 1974. 



At the 2500-acre Center near Annapolis, a long-term study of the 

 Rhode River watershed continues with nsf-rann (National Science 

 Foundation-Research AppUed to National Needs) as the major 

 source of funding. The current grant extends through September 

 1974 and was made through the Chesapeake Research Consortium, 

 composed of the Smithsonian Institution, the Johns Hopkins Uni- 

 versity, the University of Maryland, and the Virginia Institute of 

 Marine Science. 



Thirteen NSF-funded projects are underway at the Center. They 

 are part of the Consortium's effort to determine the environmental 

 impact of alternate levels of sewage effluent loading in specified parts 

 of the Bay. 



The Center's contribution is to provide understanding of the bio- 

 logical functioning of an ecosystem and from this to devise methods 

 for determining the impact of sewage effluent. Projects include in- 

 vestigations of the amount of groundwater and runoff in the Rhode 

 River watershed, the circulation patterns of the estuary, and the 

 water exchange with the Bay. Water samples collected at stations in 

 the estuary are analyzed for chemical content. 



Stream gauging wiers were constructed during the year to record 

 the volume of water flowing from five subwatersheds and to take 

 volume-integrated water samples. Scientists at the Center analyze 

 these samples for total phosphorus, total nitrogen, organic carbon, 

 and suspended sediment. 



With the aid of computer printouts of aerial photographs, scien- 

 tists are developing a key for identifying salt-marsh vegetation. 

 Funding is provided through the National Aeronautics and Space 

 Administration as part of a remote sensing project underway at the 

 Center since 1970. This year the Center began preparing land-use 

 maps of the Rhode River watershed based on these photographs. The 

 maps will be a valuable tool for a number of investigators and for 

 agencies concerned with the environment. 



Science I 61 




Since the beginning of the fiscal year, college students, under the 

 supervision of the Assistant Director, have conducted a survey of 

 the recreational use of the Rhode River. 



Two staff members are studying the mammals of Poplar, Coaches, 

 and Jefferson Islands. Owned by the Smithsonian and administered 

 by the Center, these islands off Talbot County on Maryland's East- 

 ern Shore are eroding at different rates and offer an unusual oppor- 

 tunity to study the effect on mammal populations of rapidly dimin- 

 ishing habitats in a closed system. 



Among the Center's continuing studies is "Population Dynamics 

 in Breeding Birds," begun in 1968 and projected for a 20-year period. 

 Objectives include the determination of species succession resulting 

 from successful changes in vegetation. 



INFORMATION TRANSFER 



Funded with a grant from the Edward John Noble Foundation, the 

 Information Transfer Program has as its goal the translation of sci- 

 entific results into forms which can be used by planners, government 

 officials, and resource managers who make decisions that affect the 

 Bay. In addition, the program makes environmental information 

 available to organizations and individuals. 



Projects undertaken this year include a survey of environmental 

 organizations in the Chesapeake Bay area. An environmental infor- 

 mation specialist sought to determine the issues that most concern 

 these organizations and the extent of their contacts with State offi- 

 cials and legislators. She also evaluated the effectiveness of the orga- 

 nizations and interviewed scientists to find out what lines of com- 

 munication exist between them and the general public. 



The Center co-sponsored with the Anne Arundel County Chapter 

 of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation preliminary meetings which re- 

 sulted in the formation of the South County Citizens League, 

 composed of representatives of citizens associations. The purpose is 

 to unite organizations and individuals in the intelligent examination 

 of probable future issues in order to influence public policies and 

 action. 



An all-day workshop on environmental problems was arranged 

 for the Maryland League of Women Voters and attended by repre- 

 sentatives of a number of organizations and agencies. 



62 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




The Rhode Worker, added to the Chesapeake Bay Center's fleet during the 

 year, is used for projects related to the NSF-funded Rhode River Research 

 Program. One of these projects is "Nutrient Studies on the Rhode River 

 Ecosystem," in which samples from 13 stations in a freshwater creek and the 

 estuary are tested for 16 qualities, either at the collection site or in the 

 laboratory below. 




EDUCATION 



A description of the Center's tours and programs was distributed in 

 the area, faciUtating scheduHng and resuhing in an increased num- 

 ber of requests for this service. 



The Center chartered a bus through a nonprofit hne sponsored by 

 the Community Action Agency and arranged to bring a different 

 group of sixth graders from five local schools to the Center each 

 week for "The Living Community," a project that stresses the inter- 

 relationship of living things. Before each visit, a staff member made 

 a preparatory presentation in the classroom. 



The Rhode River Environmental Education Project, one of the 

 Center's most ambitious educational efforts, got underway in the I 

 fall of 1973 after a successful pilot program. With the cooperation 

 of the YMCA of Metropolitan Washington, a different group of tenth 

 graders from 16 District of Columbia schools resided for four days 

 at a YMCA camp adjoining the Center. The students used the Center 

 for field work, and college students served as counsellors. The cur- 

 riculum, designed by the Assistant Director and an Education Spe- 

 cialist, focused on man's relationship to his environment. 



The Summer Ecology Program, an intensive course for school 

 children from the elementary grades through high school, was initi- 

 ated in the summer of 1973 and will continue in 1974. College stu- 

 dents who plan to teach the natural sciences instruct the children. 

 The program provides the instructors with teaching experience and 

 the children with an enriching supplement to their school work. 



The Center arranged an all-day workshop for science teachers 

 from all over the country who were enrolled in a summer institute 

 sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Similar workshops 

 are planned for the summer of 1974. 



Continuing education activities include opportunities for college 

 students to work with staff scientists on specific projects and pro- 

 viding speakers for schools, colleges, and organizations. 



STAFF 



The Center's full-time staff numbered approximately 40 at the close 

 of the fiscal year. Among the additions were Dr. Barbara Rice, 

 Research Speciahst with the' Remote Sensing Project; Dr. Maria 

 Faust, Biologist; Dr. Tung Lin Wu, Chemist; Dr. John Falk, Educa- 



64 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




tion Coordinator; Marjorie Beane, Environmental Information Spe- 

 cialist; and Lynne Mormann, Education Specialist. 



Some 40 additional researchers are actively engaged in projects 

 at the Chesapeake Bay Center, including principal investigators for 

 the Rhode River Research Program from the Johns Hopkins Uni- 

 versity and the University of Maryland. 



FACILITIES 

 Ground was broken in the spring for a combined Visitor Center 

 and Education Building scheduled for completion in the fall. This 

 will be the first new structure to be built at the Center since its 

 establishment in 1965. 



The Center procured seven house trailers to alleviate a shortage 

 of space for offices, laboratories, and dormitory facilities. 



A 28-foot fiberglass cabin cruiser, the Rhode Worker was added 

 to the Center's fleet. Purchased with funds from the nsf-rann grant, 

 this boat is used for projects included in the Rhode River Research 

 Program. Five other boats, including the 46-foot Java, are docked at 

 the Center's pier. 



Fort Pierce Bureau 



The primary research emphasis by the Fort Pierce Bureau this year 

 is the Indian River Study, a consortium effort initiated in Septem- 

 ber of 1973, with a grant from the Atlantic Foundation. The Smith- 

 sonian's 130-foot-floating-laboratory barge is the focal point for the 

 Study, the chief aims of which are to obtain baseline information on 

 the diversity of organisms and quality of their environment, sources 

 of pollution and their effects on organisms, and a predictive capa- 

 bility of both short- and long-term effects on man-induced changes. 

 To date, over 500 sampling stations have been occupied on 22 off- 

 shore cruises by the RV Cosnold, 10 cruises have been made in the 

 Indian River lagoon on a specially modified houseboat research ves- 

 sel to make in situ environmental measurements, and fish and ben- 

 thic samples have been repetitively collected at 36 stations and 4 

 transects within the Indian River. 



Life-history studies of marine animals have continued through 

 the second year with stress on reproductive biology, developmental 

 patterns, and larval development of unsegmented marine worms of 



Science I 65 




the phylum Sipuncula. More than 20 larval sipunculans of unknown 

 species have been collected from the Gulf Stream off Fort Pierce, 

 Florida; these have been raised in the laboratory and studies made of 

 their morphology by use of scanning electron microscopy and histo- 

 logical procedures. Developmental patterns emerging from this work 

 promise to have important implications for and understanding of the 

 interphyletic and intraphyletic relationships of these organisms. 



The former Coast Guard cutter, Hopley Yeaton, was christened 

 officially the RV Johnson on Saturday, January 26, 1974, by Mrs, 

 J. Seward Johnson during an open-house celebration at Link Port, 

 Florida. An estimated 1500 visitors attended the ceremony to view 

 the Bureau's 125-foot vessel, a tender to the research submarine 

 Johnson-Sea-Link, which can be launched and recovered rapidly by 

 a hydraulic crane located at the aft end of the ship. The "mother 

 ship"-submersible-lockout diver system will be used on missions 

 this coming year to explore, photograph, and sample the continental 

 shelf adjacent to the Indian River. 



Since the unfortunate entrapment of the Johnson-Sea-Link off the 

 Florida Keys in June 1973, considerable effort has been devoted at 

 Link Port to developing rescue systems for small research sub- 

 marines and to modifying several safety and life-support systems on 

 the Johnson-Sea-Link. A surface rescue craft, under construction, 

 will support a cable-controlled unmanned submersible equipped 

 with television and manipulator that can free an entrapped object 

 from a depth in excess of 1000 feet. A second submarine, Johnson- 

 Sea-Link II, should be finished by the end of 1974 — a sister sub- 

 mersible with lockout capability can be viewed as an excellent rescue 

 mechanism. Already implemented on the Johnson-Sea-Link are an 

 improved high-capacity and high-volume carbon-dioxide scrubber, 

 remote read-out gauges in the pilot's sphere for carbon dioxide and 

 oxygen sensing and monitoring instruments employed in the diving 

 compartment, and redesigned attachment points for handling lines, 

 which employ the break-away concept and eliminate hooks. 



During the past several months, two successful cruises have been 

 completed to the Bahamas to train the respective crews of the sup- 

 port ship RV Johnson and submarine Johnson-Sea-Link as a total 

 system, to launch and recover the submersible from anchor or 

 underway and in a sea state of Beaufort Force 5, to complete training 

 of two qualified submarine pilots, and to perform shallow submarine

and lockout operations under day and night conditions. This con- 

 scientious training program, incorporating all aspects of submersible 

 operations, diving and support-equipment handling under the able 

 management of an Operations Director, is the most effective pro- 

 cedure of reducing the accepted level of risk involved in submarine 

 work. 



National Air and Space Museum 



The progress made in building construction, exhibits, staffing, and 

 research in 1974 leaves little doubt that the National Air and Space 

 Museum is fast becoming one of the most important and exciting 

 bureaus of the Institution. 



The construction of the new museum building, which is on sched- 

 ule, is almost 50 percent complete. The contracts for structural steel 

 and metal decks have been closed out. The marble contract is 65 

 percent complete. Glass curtain walls and skylights are being 

 installed. By the end of summer, the building will be completely 

 enclosed, which will permit interior work without regard to the 

 elements. As originally forecast, the staff will move into the building 

 in the summer of 1975 and the building will open in July 1976. 



The building will contain 25 major exhibition halls and 2 presen- 

 tation centers; the development of exhibits for these halls has been 

 the major thrust of the museum during 1974 and will continue to 

 be through 1976. The goal for the opening of the building is to have 

 "core" quality exhibits in approximately 50 percent of the available 

 space with well-displayed objects in the remainder of the halls. 



During 1974 the following major exhibits were completed: 



"Air Traffic Control" — an exhibit which explains the complex 

 equipment and competent personnel who perform behind the scenes 

 in our air traffic network. 



"Exhibition Flight" — this exhibit tells the story with artifacts, 

 film, and photos of how exhibition flight caught the imagination of 

 the American public and popularized flying. 



"Life in the Universe" — this exhibit examines the birth and death 

 of stars and galaxies; the nature of life and its chemical building 

 blocks; the tools being used to find life; how this life may have 

 evolved, what forms it may have taken, and how we might commu- 

 nicate with it.

Construction moves apace on the new National Air and Space Museum scheduled 



to open July 4, 1976. 




In addition to the major exhibits, the following special exhibits 

 were mounted in 1974 : 



"Copernicus" — prototype telescope of nasa's Orbiting Astro- 

 nomical Observatory during the 500th anniversary of Copernicus, 

 the father of modern astronomy. 



"Skylab" — America's first experimental space station. 



"Aerobatics" — featuring the U.S. World Championship Aero- 

 batics team and one of their aircraft, the Pitts Special. 



"Santos-Dumont" — observing the centenary of the birth of this 

 pioneer aircraft designer, aeronaut, aviator, and astronomer. 



"Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel" — exhibiting on the 70th anni- 

 versary of powered heavier-than-air flight a replica of the wind 

 tunnel with daily demonstrations of its use as a precursor to the first 

 powered flight. 



"Space and Artists" — continuing displays of paintings of space 

 and aviation art. 



"First World Flight" — traces the first round-the-world flight 

 through photographs and drawings superimposed over a map of the 

 route taken by the pilots in 1924. During the 6-month circumnavi- 

 gation of the world, the crews endured hardships of extreme cold 

 and heat, accidents, and mechanical failures. The flagplane, Chicago, 

 was completely restored by the nasm and is the centerpiece of the 

 exhibit, in the rotunda of the Arts and Industries Building. 



Fiscal year 1974 brought the beginning of a formal program of 

 research to the museum. A Department of Science and Technology 

 was created and staffed with two senior personnel. The implementa- 

 tion of the NASM Science and Technology research program has begun 

 with an analysis of the history and validity of design criteria in use 

 in the air and space industry. A Center for Earth and Planetary 

 Studies was established under the leadership of one of the foremost 

 lunar geologists in the world. At the same time, nasa's comprehen- 

 sive lunar scientific photograph collection and records were trans- 

 ferred to the museum. The Center has already published several 

 scientific articles. In cooperation with nasa, a lunar mapping pro- 

 gram is ongoing. Moreover, the Center Director occupies one of 

 seven seats on the International Astronautical Union (iau) Task 

 Group on Lunar Nomenclature. 



Exhibits-related research is-a major nasm activity with the various 

 curatorial departments performing artifact documentary research.

The story of how exhibition flight captured the imagination of the American 

 public and popularized flying is told in the National Air and Space Museum's 

 exhibit, "Exhibition Flight," that opened in March 1974. Below: Another exhibit,

prerestoration curatorial research, and historical research. The nasm 

 Exhibits Division is developing several research programs concerned 

 with the reliability of exhibits components, new exhibits techniques, 

 novel film transport systems, etc. 



The large size of today's flying machines, coupled with an ever 

 accelerating pace of aerospace technology, results in tremendous 

 pressure on curators to increase the size of their collections. At the 

 same time, however, the available storage space is not increasing at 

 the same pace. Therefore, in January 1974, an Acquisition Policy 

 Statement was issued for use by the curatorial staff of the nasm. 

 Briefly, the policy indicates that each major addition to the collection 

 should be balanced, wherever possible, by an equivalent deletion or 

 loan. It also places the responsibility for the final approval of the 

 acquisitions of major new artifacts with the Director of the museum. 

 Prior to 1974, the curatorial staff approved acquisitions and the 

 Director approved loans. This policy has now been reversed. 



At the time the acquisition policy was enacted, the museum began 

 an all-out effort to review and, where possible, dispose of surplus 

 artifacts, particularly engines, archival material, aircraft models, 

 aircraft, and space material. To date: 



1. Fifty engines have been transferred or loaned. 



2. Approximately 12,000 cubic feet of miscellaneous material, 

 including books, periodicals, photographs, records, and other docu- 

 ments have been declared surplus or duplicate material and trans- 

 ferred to other institutions. This included over 3,500 periodicals. 



3. A complete inventory of the model aircraft collection (num- 

 bering over 1,000 models) is under way. The information will be 

 computerized so that the collection can be studied from various 

 criteria such as scale, aircraft type, condition, etc. 



4. Twenty-eight astronautic artifacts have been deaccessioned 

 and disposed of. 



During fiscal 1974, the Presentations and Education Division was 

 organized with responsibility for developing and implementing three 

 programs: the education program of the museum, Spacearium pro- 

 grams, and programs for the nasm Theater. 



The education program includes lectures, tours, and other activi- 

 ties to assist individuals and groups in using the museum, its re- 

 sources, and publications for effective learning about air and space 

 and related subject matter. In fiscal 1974, 168 tours were conducted 

 by 13 docents and volunteers for over 5000 students. 



72 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




During fiscal 1974, a small planetarium began an ongoing opera- 

 tion in the Air and Space Building as an experimental laboratory to 

 prepare for the larger Spacearium. Programs were given to general 

 visitors and to a few visiting school classes, and special classes were 

 conducted in this facility for the Smithsonian Associates. 



Two pilot programs were initiated in fiscal 1974 at the Silver 

 Hill facility. The first was an adult night class for those who might 

 build and fly their own airplanes, and emphasized safe and rational 

 design, engineering, and maintenance. The second program was 

 designed to teach inner-city children the basic skills required to build 

 and maintain aircraft, including welding, sheet metal and fabric 

 work, engine overhaul, etc. Both programs were well received and 

 will be expanded in the future. 



For the second year the museum, in conjunction with the Smith- 

 sonian Astrophysical Observatory, hosted an astronomy lecture 

 series. While the first series in 1972 attempted to assess man's cur- 

 rent knowledge of the solar system as seen from the planet Earth, 

 the second series, "Beyond the Planets," surveyed our Galaxy and 

 the Universe from the vantage point of the Sun. The series, consist- 

 ing of eight lectures by some of America's outstanding astronomers, 

 was received with enthusiasm by standing-room-only crowds. 



As a special event, the museum sponsored a poetry reading and 

 discussion by Apollo 15 Astronaut Alfred Worden. Astronaut 

 Worden was warmly received as he read selections from his book 

 of poems. Hello Earth, Greetings From Endeavor, and discussed his 

 feelings and emotions that prompted him to compose each of the 

 poems. The readings were illustrated by color panoramas made 

 during Apollo 15's epic journey to the Moon.

National Museum of Natural History 



There was a bustle of activity on the Museum's first floor in early 

 1974 as carpenters, scientists, designers, and other Museum crafts- 

 men worked to complete "Ice Age Mammals and the Emergence of 

 Man," the first of a series of new exhibits that will enrich consider- 

 ably the Museum's educational impact. Long-range plans call for the 

 overhaul and rejuvenation of one permanent exhibit hall every year 

 through 1979. All of these new halls will be thematically structured 

 to convey clearly to the public concepts of evolution that are funda- 

 mental to an understanding of the natural world. 



To accomplish this change the Museum has departed from its 

 traditional practice of building an exhibit hall around a single depart- 

 mental discipline. The Ice Age Hall formerly housed a paleontological 

 exhibit devoted to Pleistocene mammals. Its replacement is multi- 

 disciplinary, blending objects from the paleontology, mineral science, 

 and anthropology collections, into a thematic context that describes 

 the great physical and biological events of the Ice Age, including the 

 development of the continental glaciers, the evolution of large 

 mammals, the extinction of many of them, and the arrival of man. 



The new multidisciplinary thematic exhibits that are in the process 

 of design and production are the result of an entirely new approach 

 to exhibits at the Museum. An advisory committee of Museum scien- 

 tists, headed by Dr. Leo J. Hickey, has been set up as a liaison 

 between the Museum's professional staff and its exhibits office, 

 directed by Harry T. Hart. A close working relationship has been 

 established that is responsible for the excellence of the new Ice Age 

 Hall and the promise of the Museum's Bicentennial exhibit, "Our 

 Changing Land." 



"Our Changing Land," now under development, will chronicle 

 environmental change in the Washington, D.C., area since the arrival 

 of man, stressing what has happened since the founding of the 

 Nation, and explaining the main ecological processes related to the 

 change and what options there may be for the future. The ground 

 floor of the north wing is being prepared for this exhibit. 



In addition to renewal of permanent halls and the development of 

 the Bicentennial exhibit, a variety of other exhibit events made 1974 

 at the Museum an extraordinarily active and vigorous year.

 scientific collections of the Museum. Mr. Hasinger is Director of Paul and

Curious children and adults were crowding into the Museum's 

 recently opened Discovery Room where they were urged to keep 

 their hands on and not off the exhibits. Elephant tusks, coral, petri- 

 fied wood, wooly mammoth teeth, and hundreds of other natural 

 history specimens, ordinarily out of reach behind glass or railings 

 in museums, could be grasped, turned over in the hand at one's 

 leisure, and studied with a magnifying glass. If requested, one of the 

 room's docents would make available books and film loops to help 

 take a person farther down the path of discovery. The room added 

 a permanent new dimension to the Museum's offerings. 



In another area of the Museum, visitors were experiencing the 

 wonder of setting foot in the interior of a tropical rain forest, one of 

 nature's most complex environments. Modeled of papier-mache and

plastic, after sketches and photographs taken in the Panama and 

 South American jungles, the exhibit's trees, foliage, and vines were 

 enclosed in a mirrored ceiling-high silo. Walking into this dimly lit 

 enclosure, visitors had the illusion that they were in the center of a 

 vast tropical forest — with trees rising 80-100 feet above their heads. 

 This simulated forest was the heart of a larger ecological exhibit, 

 '"It All Depends," which made the point that all elements in the 

 environment are dependent upon each other for survival. 



Looking alertly out from an "arctic ice floe" in the west end of the 

 Life in the Sea Hall was an imposing new Museum presence, a 

 mounted specimen of that largest of the fin-footed aquatic animals — 

 the sea walrus. Beneath its icy perch a visitor could see an informative 

 film about it and other pinnipeds, a family of mammals that besides 

 the walrus includes the seal and the sea lion. In a narration inspired 

 by the Lewis Carroll verse, "The Walrus and the Carpenter," actor 

 Cyril Ritchard could be heard addressing a pinniped, "I would like 

 to talk to you, about how you live, where you live and the things 

 you like to do." 



The Museum once again made clear its opposition to the un- 

 limited killing of members of that other great family of sea mammals.

the cetaceans, to which belong the porpoises, dolphins, and whales. 

 In May and June it was host to an exhibition organized by Project 

 Jonah's International Children's Campaign to Save the Whales. 

 Drawings by elementary school children from the District of Co- 

 lumbia and its suburbs protesting the killing of whales were hung 

 side-by-side with works by young artists from other cities in Amer- 

 ica and foreign countries. 



Two other colorful and notable exhibits in the Museum's foyer 

 area were the offshoot of the field research trips of two of the 

 Museum's scientists. One was a display of large, dye-transfer color 

 prints of tropical blossoms photographed in Africa and South Amer- 

 ica by Dr. Edward S. Ayensu, Chairman of the Museum's Depart- 

 ment of Botany (supplemented with pictures by the Museum's 

 scientific photographer, Kjell B. Sandved), the other placed on view 

 ethnological materials from the eastern Himalayan country of Bhu- 

 tan, collected by Dr. Eugene I. Knez, the Museum's Curator of 

 Asian Anthropology. This exhibit was planned to coincide with the 

 June coronation of Bhutan's 19-year-old king, and included the 

 display of photographs, paintings, textiles, costumes, copper, gold 

 and silver vessels, religious objects, basketry, and pottery. Among 



Science I 79 




the lenders to the exhibit was Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon 

 Ripley, who has made several expeditions to Bhutan. 



Two Museum physical anthropologists, Drs. J. Lawrence Angel 

 and Douglas H. Ubelaker, in separate paleodemographic studies in 

 the Old and New Worlds, are amassing evidence of how environ- 

 mental conditions influenced the health, longevity, and evolution 

 of prehistoric man. 



Working closely with archeologists who have unearthed grave 

 sites, the two scientists make measurements of ancient skeletal 

 material. From this they can assemble a body of statistics about an 

 ancient community that includes the size of its population, the age 

 composition, birth rate, sex ratio, number of children born, family 

 size, and critical effects of diseases such as arthritis and malaria — 

 all of which are determined by diet, climate, living habits, and 

 heredity. 



Dr. Angel's work over the last decade has been concentrated on 

 Eastern Mediterranean burial sites such as Catal Hiiyiik, Turkey, 

 where a population of early neolithic hunting farmers and traders, 

 living in a compact pueblo-like community, had conquered the peril 

 of a high child mortality rate — probably caused by malaria — by 

 evolving a culture that venerated and protected women. This had 

 lengthened the lives and childbearing years of the women. The 

 population of the community had increased as a result, and it had 

 become possible for the women to make a rich contribution to the 

 community's art, crafts, and religious activities, while the men were 

 hunting and trading. 



The People of Lerna: An Analysis of a Prehistoric Aegean Popu- 

 lation, published by the Smithsonian Institution Press, is Dr. Angel's 

 study of a site situated on the Bay of Argos, Greece, where archeolo- 

 gists found 235 Bronze Age graves, covering a span of 25 generations 

 (2000-1600 B.C.). 



The demographic profile Dr. Angel constructed showed that adults 

 in Lerna (which he estimated had about 800 persons living in it 

 during the Middle Bronze Age) had an average life expectancy of 

 34 years — 37 for men, 31 for women. The average woman bore 

 about five children — 2.2 of which grew to adulthood (15 years of 

 age). On the basis of that birth rate the population was increasing, 

 doubling every 7 to 10 generations. This was a remarkably successful 

 adaptation to the handicapping diseases afflicting the community. 



80 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




Mask from the exhibition "Bhutan: The Land of Dragons." 



Malaria, in particular, had a crippling impact, just as it had had 

 at Catal Hiiyiik. The changeover from a hunting to a farming culture, 

 which had begun in the Mediterranean between 9000 to 6500 B.C. 

 with the disappearance of the big game herds, had drawn early 

 farming populations to sites like Lerna where the soil was soft and 

 the forests not established. But these well-watered marshy areas that 

 favored farming also favored the Anopheles mosquito and the result 

 was that malaria, especially the type known as falciparum malaria, 

 was rampant. The physical debilitation caused by this disease 



Science I 81 




plagued and weakened Lerna for most of its prehistoric period (the 

 average stature of the Lerna men was only 5' 5V2'' and women, 

 5' V4 ") . It was not until later when Greek communities learned how 

 to drain their marshes to gain better control of irrigation and water 

 supply that the numbers of malaria-carrying mosquitos were re- 

 duced, a development reflected in the stature and longevity of the 

 people. 



Dr. Angel's colleague, Douglas Ubelaker, has been analyzing 

 skeletal material from a large pre-Columbian cemetery in the 

 Hacienda Ayalan, Guayas Province, on the south coast of Ecuador, 

 dating to a.d. 1300, where 50 large ceramic urns, each containing 

 up to 20 skeletons, were uncovered. 



With the approval of the Ecuadorian Government all of this 

 material was shipped back to the Museum, where now, highly 

 accurate microscopic methods of determining age by osteon counts 

 were conducted. The results were startling. The population had an 

 average adult age at death of about 67 years, with many individuals 

 living into the eighth and ninth decade, a much higher figure than 

 one would expect for a prehistoric population. 



It can be explained by the fact the site provided excellent nutrition. 

 The people took crops from the land and exploited fresh- and salt- 

 water food resources. Many of the diseases that historically lower 

 life expectancy (syphilis, malaria, measles, mumps, smallpox) either 

 were nonexistent or were not severe problems until the Spanish 

 arrived. Furthermore, there is some evidence of remarkable con- 

 temporary longevity along that part of the coast that may have 

 extended back into prehistory. 



Stands of Japanese Ma-dake timber bamboo (Phyllostachys 

 bambusoides) are flowering throughout America, a cyclical phenom- 

 enon that takes place only at intervals of 120 years and is as rare to 

 botanists as Halley's comet is to astronomers. Drs. Thomas R. 

 Soderstrom and C. E. Calderon, Museum scientists, have been 

 monitoring this dramatic botanical event. Last year they asked for 

 help from readers of Smithsonian magazine and the Smithsonian's 

 Environmental Alert Network, which alerted high school science 

 classes all over the country. Hundreds of persons, young and old, 

 responded by mailing in dried specimens of flowering branches of 

 the bamboo plant and along with it information about precisely 

 where it was collected and photographs and short histories of the 



82 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




Dr. Thomas R. Soderstrom, Curator of Grasses, Department of Botany, 

 examining specimens of flowering bamboo. 



Stands from which it came. With these data, Drs. Soderstrom and 

 Calderon were able to draw up a map that pinpoints Ma-dake stands 

 in at least 22 states, showing its heaviest concentrations on the West 

 Coast, from Washington to California, and in the southeastern Gulf 

 states. 



Science I 83 




The flowering of Ma-dake is always followed by the death of the 

 plant's culms (stems), and this was verified by the volunteer observ- 

 ers. In cases where the flowering and death cycle had taken place in 

 the late 1960s, they noticed that the old rhizomes (underground 

 stem masses) were regenerating themselves and producing many 

 new but weak, contorted shoots. Drs. Soderstrom and Calderon 

 point out that it may take 6 or more years before large, normal 

 shoots are again grown, and perhaps 15 years before the bamboo 

 clump is in the same condition prior to flowering. In Japan Ma-dake 

 is used as a raw material for the construction of homes, furniture, 

 farm implements, baskets, and even food, and it is easy to under- 

 stand why the cyclical flowering there is considered nothing less 

 than a disaster. 



All of the Ma-dake stands do not flower simultaneously because 

 there are a number of time-oriented, hereditary lines, consisting of 

 segregated progeny, distributed throughout the world. Each of these 

 hereditary lines is on a 120-year cycle. These cycles began to come 

 to completion in the late 1950s, but most of them in America have 

 done so in the late 1960s. Drs. Soderstrom and Calderon predict 

 that the present flowering will end shortly, but will begin again in 

 the 2070s, continue through the 2080s, and terminate in the 2090s. 



The covered jars in Dr. Donald R. Davis's laboratory are full of 

 blotched and discolored leaves on which one can see curious lines. 

 Some of the lines are crooked, some are coiled in a serpentine man- 

 ner, and others strike out in every direction from a central patch, 

 creating a star-shaped pattern. The leaves were collected by Dr. 

 Davis from the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia, but they could 

 just as well be from almost any garden, park, or forest in America, 

 The marks on the leaves are the work of leaf miners, insect larvae 

 of minute size that can infest every leaf of a plant or tree and do 

 enough aggregate damage to kill their host. In Canada, the miners 

 have been so destructive to spruce and fir trees in the Western 

 Provinces in the last few years that the Government has initiated 

 a biological study of these insects in hopes of finding a means of 

 control. 



Last year. Dr. Davis, Curator at the Museum's Department of 

 Entomology, began work on a biosystematic study directed 

 specifically at four important families of leaf-mining Microlepidop- 

 tera (Eriocraniidae, Nepticulidae, Heliozelidae, and Gracillariidea). 



84 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




Dr. Donald R. Davis, Curator of Lepidoptera, Department of Entomology, 

 examining leaves with tell-tale markings left by leaf miners. 




Mining behavior of almost every description, ranging from the most 

 highly specialized to some of the most primitive forms, is practiced 

 within these four groups. 



One of the things Dr. Davis wants to do through his study of 

 these families is to trace the evolutionary history of mining. Re- 

 cently, Dr. Leo J. Hickey, a Museum paleobotanist, found a Nepticu- 

 lid leaf mine on a lower Cretaceous Angiosperm leaf, a discovery 

 that extends this basic ecological association between plants and 

 insects back nearly 110 million years. Dr. Davis is now examining 

 the Smithsonian-U.S. Geological Survey collection of Cretaceous 

 and early Tertiary Angiosperms for further evidence of early Lepi- 

 doptera leaf-mining injury. 



The mined leaves that Dr. Davis collects on trips to habitats like 

 the Great Dismal Swamp and the Great Smoky Mountains are 

 brought back to his Museum laboratory so that the miner larvae 

 can be reared, identified, and closely observed. Dr. Davis plans 

 studies of all phases of their life cycle, including oviposition, larval 

 development, mine morphology, pupation, and adult behavior. He is 

 also interested in correlating the systematics and behavior of the 

 moths with that of their plant hosts. Why does a particular species 

 of miner often only feed on a particular species of plant? 



But before such intriguing biological questions can be seriously 

 studied, basic taxonomic revisions must be prepared. Much of the 

 classification of the four families was done in the nineteenth century, 

 an age when moth investigators described the color and venation 

 of wings — but little else. The skeleton, which is now recognized 

 as the best part of the insect on which to base a taxonomic diagnosis, 

 was often ignored. Dr. Davis has had to start out by eliminating 

 the confusion this has created. He is now assembling comprehensive 

 illustrated texts to facilitate rapid, accurate identification for the 

 approximately 365 presently recognized North American species and 

 the more than 100 new species that have come to light in his studies. 



What will happen if the sea-level canal the U.S. Government has 

 proposed constructing sometime in the future across the Isthmus of 

 Panama mixes the animal and plant groups of the Atlantic and 

 Pacific sides? Scientists say that serious ecological disruptions could 

 follow. Dr. Meredith L. Jones, Curator of Worms in the Museum's 

 Department of Invertebrate Zoology, saw several years ago that the 

 lack of fundamental knowledge about the communities of marine 



86 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




animals that live in the shallow waters on both sides of the isthmus 

 would make it extremely difficult to assess the nature of these dis- 

 ruptions after they occur. Well-documented collections were needed 

 to provide a benchmark for future investigations. To assemble these. 

 Dr. Jones organized the Museum's Panama Biota Program. 



The original qualitative collecting method involved hand-picking 

 the organisms from the surface of a sieve that had been used to 

 process an undetermined amount of sediment. Dr. Jones and his 

 colleagues devised a quantitative method that they are now using 

 to get true samples of the density and diversity of invertebrate 

 organisms living in Panama's coastal waters. Collections are made 

 while the tide is still high. Standing in water that is anywhere from 

 ankle to waist deep, the scientists drive a cubical stainless steel 

 jacket, that has an area of 1/20 of a square meter, 8 inches down 

 into the mud. Then they slide a shovel under the jacket, draw it out 

 of the bottom, sieve the sample, and bottle all of the residue. In 

 typical samples taken the new way, the yields comprised an average 

 of about 1800 specimens per square meter on a clean sand beach on 

 the Atlantic coast, about 6400 specimens per square meter on a 

 muddy sand beach on the Pacific, and about 46,000 specimens per 

 square meter in an Atlantic turtle-grass bed. 



Five samples are usually taken at each collection station in order 

 to insure that contrasting microenvironments within a habitat are 

 represented. An effort has also been made to take samples at each 

 station at every season of the year. 



At the Museum, a technician-student has been making quantita- 

 tive counts of invertebrate life forms in each sample, classifying the 

 animals by families. There is such an abundance of life in each 

 sample that processing it takes the technician six full days of work. 

 When Dr. Jones examines the worms in a sample to identify them 

 at a species level, six more days of work are involved. He estimates 

 that it will take him three to four years to get through all of the 

 samples that have been collected. 



If a sea-level canal should be constructed. Dr. Jones is satisfied 

 that now scientists will be able to go back to the same site, make new 

 collections, and then make comparisons that will show them what is 

 happening, and enable them to predict what will happen next and 

 if it will be beneficial or harmful. If the sea-level canal is never 

 constructed. Dr. Jones believes the Program is still well worthwhile. 



Science I 87 




It is accumulating collections of unique value in an area of tremen- 

 dous biological interest. 



The present Panama Canal with freshwater lakes situated mid- 

 way along its length has proved a highly effective barrier to the 

 passage of marine life from one side of Central America to the other. 

 So a scientist's curiosity is aroused when a marine fish native to the 

 Pacific shows up in the Caribbean. Dr. Victor G. Springer, Curator 

 of Fishes in the Museum's Department of Vertebrate Zoology, re- 

 cently looked into the matter of a tropical Indo-West Pacific blenniid 

 fish population living off Trinidad and the Atlantic entrance to the 

 Canal. Was it a relic population that was once distributed through- 

 out the world's tropic waters or had it been artificially introduced, 

 conceivably through the Canal? 



The facts argued against its being a relic population. Members of 

 the blenniid family speciate rapidly and no blenniid species is found 

 in both the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic Oceans, which were 

 last connected 2 to 4 million years ago. If the fish had once been 

 widely distributed in the tropics, its Indo-West Pacific and Caribbean 

 populations would have evolved into different species since the rise 

 of the isthmus. Dr. Springer concluded that it must have been arti- 

 ficially introduced into the western Atlantic, probably by the dis- 

 charge of ballast or bilge waters of ships. The fish is small and 

 found in abundance around docks where it can easily be sucked 

 into a ship's ballast tanks. Other small marine fish have been picked 

 up in this way, taken thousands of miles, released when the ship 

 discharged its bilge waters, and established breeding populations. 

 But this is the only instance of a fish being introduced in this way 

 into the Caribbean. 



Did the ships that brought the fish to the Caribbean enter through 

 the Canal? Dr. Springer thinks not. Ships coming across the Pacific 

 discharge their bilge-ballast water before they enter the Canal; that 

 being the case, the fish should be established on the Pacific side of 

 the Canal. But it has never been found there or anywhere else in the 

 eastern Pacific, but it does occur at the Atlantic entrance to the 

 Canal. Trinidad is where the fish has its principal Caribbean popula- 

 tion and where it was first collected in the Atlantic in 1930. Dr. 

 Springer believes that instead of coming across the Pacific, the fish 

 arrived in Trinidad from the Indo-West Pacific via the Atlantic 

 before the Canal was first opened in 1914.

The trail led Dr. Springer to the East Indian coolie trade that flour- 

 ished between Calcutta and Madras, on the east coast of India, and 

 the West Indies islands in the years from 1838 to 1914 and 1917. In 

 that period, thousands of coolies arrived on ships that traveled from 

 India to the Caribbean around southern Africa. It is Dr. Springer's 

 view that the coolie trade vessels were the vehicles that introduced 

 Omobranchus punctatus into the western Atlantic. 



Garnet can be yellow, orange, red, lilac or purple, depending on 

 its chemical composition and upon the temperature and pressure 

 conditions under which it formed in the earth. It has long been 

 known by scientists that this colorful mineral occurs in varying 

 quantities in kimberlite pipes, the bodies of igneous rock that are the 

 primary source of diamonds. But the fact that there was a high or 

 low concentration of garnet in a pipe did not seem to indicate one 

 way or the other if there was an abundance or dearth of diamonds 

 present. Last year, however. Dr. George S. Switzer, Curator of Min- 

 eralogy in the Museum's Department of Mineral Science, discovered 

 that certain lilac-colored garnets have special compositional charac- 

 teristics that make it possible to say that if they are present in a 

 pipe, it is a diagnostic indication that diamonds are likely to be found 

 there in economic quantities. 



These garnets are formed — as diamonds are — in the earth's 

 upper mantle at a depth of 100-150 miles. When molten kimberlite 

 forces its way to the surface at velocities estimated to be on the order 

 of 300-400 feet per second, it sometimes brings both of these min- 

 erals up with it from the earth's interior. The garnet is found in the 

 pipes in rocks called xenoliths (eclogites and periodites) and some- 

 times in diamonds as minute inclusions. Because of its occurrence in 

 diamonds, all of the garnet was thought by some scientists to have 

 crystallized (reached equilibrium) at the same time, place, and tem- 

 perature as the diamonds. Another school of thought, however, 

 held that the garnets in kimberlite xenoliths crystallized at lower 

 temperatures than garnet inside the diamond. 



These two opposing views were tested by Dr. Switzer in a detailed 

 study of the garnet in the Finsch kimberlite pipe, one of the richest 

 diamond mines in South Africa. Finsch is also rich in garnet. It 

 makes up 90 percent of the mineral concentrate recovered there dur- 

 ing the diamond extraction process. 



Dr. Switzer brought back to the Museum a handful of garnet

grains of all colors that had been recovered at Finsch in the extraction 

 process. He sorted 300 of these on the basis of color into eight cate- 

 gories and analyzed them on the Department's electron microprobe, 

 which can identify and quantify the elements within each grain. 



The results showed that some of the grains of lilac-colored gar- 

 nets — magnesum rich and calcium poor — had a chromium con- 

 tent that placed them within the compositional field of the garnets 

 previously only reported as inclusions in diamonds. Dr. Switzer, who 

 is now testing garnets from other kimberlite pipes, believes that the 

 presence of lilac-colored diamond of this special composition is diag- 

 nostic of the presence of diamond in a pipe, but it is not known yet 

 if there is any quantitative relationship.

Dr. Daniel J. Stanley, Geological Oceanographer and Curator in 

 the Museum's Department of Paleobiology, is helping piece together 

 a detailed knowledge of the physical processes that shape the Medi- 

 terranean region, a project that often finds him out on an oceano- 

 graphic vessel taking sediment cores from the Mediterranean Sea 

 bed. The recent development of deep-sea drilling technology as well 

 as submersibles — deep-sea* cameras, underwater television, and 

 very high resolution seismic profilers — have made it possible for

him and other scientists to carry out revolutionary studies that make 

 it apparent that the configuration of the Mediterranean Sea, as we; 

 know it today, is a geologically recent phenomenon. 



This emerging picture of geologic change includes Dr. Stanley's 

 discovery of sedimentological evidence for the existence of a large 

 emerged land mass present in the area now occupied by the Ligurian 

 Sea (between the Riviera and Corsica, in the western Mediterranean) 

 until early Tertiary time. Seismic studies of the present Ligurian Sea 

 floor, and examination of exposed sediments found in the French 

 Maritime Alps, Corsica, and the northwestern Apennines of Italy, 

 confirm that this land mass foundered and became submerged after 

 the Oligocene. 



Finding specimens of exposed ancient sedimentary deposits — 

 now uplifted to 10,000 feet above sea level in the mountain chains 

 that surround the Mediterranean — is one part of Dr. Stanley's i 

 work that does not require advanced technology. For this. Dr. Stan- 

 ley depends upon his keen geologist's eye and his skill as a mountain 

 climber. 



The publication in 1973 of the 765-page bilingual volume The 

 Mediterranean Sea: A Natural Sedimentation Laboratory, edited by 

 Dr. Stanley and Drs. Gilbert Kelling and Yehezkiel Weiler, was the 

 result of Dr. Stanley's determination to achieve a needed multi- 

 disciplinary and multinational synthesis of current research in sedi- 

 mentation and related fields in the Mediterranean and circum- 

 Mediterranean. The book has contributions by 85 specialists from 

 15 countries, all of whom participated in a symposium organized by 

 Dr. Stanley in 1971 at the VIII International Sedimentological Con- 

 gress in Heidelberg. 



The book includes an outline of criteria for a needed international 

 effort to find out what happens to pollutants when they are intro- 

 duced into the Mediterranean, where they go, and what their conse- 

 quences are. It calls for the construction of monitoring stations to 

 detect and map sediment and pollutant dispersal and depositation; 

 aerial flights and space-satellite photography to monitor the dis- 

 charge of sediments from river mouths, and rates of serious erosion 

 along selected coastlines (such as the Nile Delta area affected by the 

 Aswan Dam); and, finally, more deep-sea drilling to resolve addi- 

 tional questions of the Mediterranean's geological and stratigraphic 

 background.

National Zoological Park 



The National Zoological Park is accelerating its change from cages 

 for containment of species to open arenas for awareness of the rela- 

 tionship of all living things; from a consumer of animals out of the 

 wild into a conservator and producer of animals and into a major 

 zoological resource of animal knowledge that can be disseminated 

 around the world. 



In fiscal year 1974, the Zoo advanced efforts to establish new 

 standards of excellence and responsibility in all areas of zoological 

 park programs with concurrent courses of action: 



Rebuilding yesterday's zoo for tomorrow's purpose. 



Marshalling the most creative contributions of all staff members. 



Launching necessary programs in off-site breeding and research. 



Studying the relationships of animals to one another, to place and 

 to time — and in time for survival. 



Coordinating resources in forms that will reach people of all ages 

 and walks of life.

RESEARCH AND CONSERVATION CENTER 



Perhaps the Zoo's most notable achievement since its founding in 

 1890 was receiving, in January 1974, a permit for 3200 acres of 

 land in Front Royal, Virginia, that formerly served successively as a 

 United States Army Remount Depot for horse breeding, and the 

 United States Department of Agriculture as a Beef Cattle Experi- 

 ment Station. 



The acquisition of this propagation and research facility — to be 

 known as the National Zoological Park's Research and Conservation 

 Center — will mark the end of the long search for a country facility 

 which could be used to breed and maintain animal herds in sufficient 

 numbers to insure their continuation as a viable, social, and genetic 

 group. The educational mission of the National Zoological Park 

 located in the valley of Rock Creek in Washington precludes the use 

 of vast amounts of land for a single species so that it is not able to 

 maintain ongoing herds of animals with proper age-pyramid and 

 genetic mixture. Considering the worldwide shrinking of land areas 

 available to wild animals, the increased hazards of disease, poach- 

 ing, and land degradation by humans, the plight of many animals is 

 indeed precarious. It is hoped that by establishing herds of threat- 

 ened and endangered species at the Research and Conservation Cen- 

 ter, in some cases through collaboration with other zoos in the United 

 States, the Zoo will have a steady and reliable source of animals as 

 well as a source for continuing zoological research on behalf of these 

 species. 



The development of the Research and Conservation Center will 

 be deliberately paced, and future reports will carry information con- 

 cerning its advancement. This year the Zoo was able to enclose 80 

 acres of rolling pasture for the first two resident groups of animals 

 — Scimitar-horned Oryx and Pere David's Deer. 



The Front Royal Center will be an extension of the Rock Creek 

 Park facility with major input in the first few years from the Offices 

 of Animal Management, Animal Health, Zoological Research, Con- 

 struction Management, and Facilities Management. Public informa- 

 tion efforts at the Center focus now on the animal's needs for isola- 

 tion and space. Low-key programs in conservation, education, and 

 natural viewing will be planned for coexistence with the principal 

 mission in future years. When we speak of the National Zoological

Park, we are now referring to 3400 acres in two locations but with 

 one purpose, one management, and one organization. 



ANIMAL AFFAIRS 



The most interesting and exciting animal event was the birth of an 

 Indian Rhinoceros in January, marking the first successful breeding 

 of this endangered species in the Western Hemisphere. This achieve- 

 ment was the result of almost two years of concerted and integrated 

 efforts by the scientific research staff, curators, keepers, and even 

 volunteers who remained in the Zoo after hours to monitor the male's 

 and female's activities during mating and later at birth. Therefore, 

 the Zoo not only gained a 127-pound male (named Patrick in honor

of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, our United States Ambassador to In- 

 dia), but also a wealth of valuable data on courtship, mating, and 

 parturition behavior. At six months of age, we estimate Patrick's 

 weight to be about 350 pounds; however, he is too rambunctious to 

 get onto the scales. 



Among the antelope, the most outstanding birth was that of a 

 lovely female calf to Kanitia, the imported Bongo; and the hope of 

 a second-generation birth on her mother's side to Nyandarua, Kan- 

 itia's offspring of two years ago. Nyandarua was the first Bongo 

 bred and born in captivity in the world. 



The lesser pandas gave birth to their second pair of kits on the 

 next to last day of the fiscal year so were not mentioned in last year's 

 report, and as if to catch us again, their pair from the year before 

 provided the Zoo with young on the night of June 30, 1974. 



The white-cheeked gibbon family produced a fine offspring to the 

 delight of the staff and the visitors; and for the first time at the 

 National Zoological Park, the binturongs produced young, which 

 are being closely studied both for their growth and development as 

 well as their behavioral relationship with the mother. The golden 

 marmoset program continues to go well in terms of understanding 

 the tie-in of behavior and reproduction. The Zoo now has 20 ani- 

 mals with birth this year of a first set of second-generation offspring 

 as well as a set of twins from a wild-caught pair. 



Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, the giant pandas, continue to thrive 

 and hold the interest of the visiting public, behaving in their new 

 yards rather like children released from school because of snow — 

 rolling, somersaulting, playfully demolishing snowmen made for the 

 occasion by the keepers. They are still unquestionably the most 

 popular animals at the Zoo. Ling-Ling, the female, now weighs 250 

 pounds and Hsing-Hsing, the male, weighs 264 pounds. Studies on 

 their behavior, vocalization, social relationships, and general habits 

 are continuing with the assistance of volunteers from the Friends of 

 the National Zoo to the scientific research staff and to the keeper 

 and curatorial personnel. This April, Ling-Ling came into estrus, 

 and we all had high hopes that there would be a breeding, particu- 

 larly with the promising experiences of last year. However, although 

 the animals got along well with the normal amount of premating, 

 roughhouse play, vocalizations, and general juvenile nonsense, there 

 was no actual breeding. No doubt this has been a further learning 



Science I 99 




experience for the male, but it appeared to be a frustrating experi- 

 ence for the female. There are hopes for a breeding in the fall season, 

 but if not then perhaps next spring when they are both older and 

 wiser from their two encounters. 



Despite the move of the white tigers (Mohini and Rewati) to Chi- 

 cago's Brookfield Zoo and the white-gene carrying Ramana and 

 Kesari to the Cincinnati Zoo to allow replacement of the old Lion 

 House, the latter pair added a new chapter to the breeding program 

 by producing four cubs, three of which are white. A normal-colored ^i 

 male, along with a white male were taken from the mother for hand- 

 rearing and are doing well under the expert care of the Cincinnati 

 staff, and the same can be said for the two, unsexed animals who 

 remain with their mother, Kesari. Unfortunately, the sire Ramana 

 passed away the week before with a chronic kidney condition, which 

 is so often seen in the big cats between 10 or 12 years of age. These 

 four new cubs give great hope for continuing the line of white tigers 

 and should be a stellar attraction when the "Dr. William M. Mann 

 Lion and Tiger Exhibit" is completed, hopefully in early 1976. 



Among the outstanding bird hatchings can be counted the con- 

 tinuation of the Bornean Great Argus Pheasant breeding program 

 with the successful raising of 12 of these young birds. Rivaling the 

 success of this program was the raising of three Nene Geese for the 

 first time in the history of the Zoo. Other outstanding hatchings 

 include three Stanley's Cranes, ten Rheas, and three American 

 Mergansers. 



Among the reptiles, the most notable breeding was of the Bur- 

 mese pythons in which three clutches were laid and 45 young snakes 

 were hatched. This program was of great scientific interest as incu- 

 bation of the eggs was carried out both artificially and naturally. In 

 the latter case the females coiled around the egg masses, maintaining 

 the proper body heat by rhythmic muscle twitchings. This process 

 was of great interest to the visitors and particularly so since electrical 

 sensors were connected to recording thermometers to trace tempera- 

 ture fluctuations. 



The breeding program at the National Zoological Park is pro- 

 gressing quite well, space permitting, and the efforts of the scientific 

 research department's behavioral studies, the contributions from the 

 animal health department on nutrition, preventive medicine, as well 

 as the diligent endeavors of the animal management department are

 The probes under the pythons are attached to a telethermometer in order to

beginning to pay off. At the present tinne, 66 percent of all mammals 

 exhibited at the Zoo are captive born either here or at other zoos. 

 Approximately 30 percent of the mammals species, 14 percent of 

 the bird species, 8 percent of the reptile and amphibian species in 

 the collection are breeding. This is a slight but significant increase 

 over previous years. 



While it is pleasant to report on significant births, note must also 

 be taken of deaths, and four famous old-timers at the Zoo have 

 passed on. Pokodiak, a female hybrid bear (Alaskan Brown X Polar 

 Bear), born in 1936, died in April at the age of 38 years. She is the 

 last of the National Zoological Park's famous hybrid bears which 

 had such an eminently popular appeal due to their great size and 

 unusual family background. Biggy, the 14-foot saltwater crocodile, 

 one of the largest crocodilians in captivity, died this March after 

 42 years on exhibition. He was a spectacular animal and well beloved 

 by his visitors. The Silver-crested Cockatoo, Richard, originally 

 known as Jacob, died in February. This bird was brought back from 

 Sumatra as a mature bird by Dr. Mann with the 1937 National 

 Geographic/Smithsonian Institution Expedition. He had been for 

 many years in the home of a Dutch plantation owner and spoke a 

 smattering of Dutch and Indonesian. He was a great delight to the 

 visitors, being an excellent talker. He soon learned English, and one 

 of his favorite phrases, "open the door, Richard," gradually brought 

 about his change in name by which in later years he was known. 

 This bird was thoroughly imprinted on human beings and would 

 have nothing to do with his feathered kin, preferring the company 

 of humans; for this reason since 1965 he was exhibited in the Ele- 

 phant House to the delight of thousands of children if not to the 

 delight of the hippopotamuses, his nearest neighbors. His maniacal 

 laughter, joyous whistling, and general rowdiness will be missed. He 

 has been replaced by an Amazon parrot, who was given to the Zoo 

 as a pet similarly imprinted. 



ANIMAL HEALTH AND PATHOLOGY 

 The animal health programs have continued with ongoing investi- 

 gative research. With the addition of an assistant veterinarian, the 

 program has been greatly accelerated, including initiation of a train- 

 ing course for Animal Keepers to expand their ability to recognize 

 deviation from healthful behavior and habits which may signify the

existence of potential health problems. The death rate has lessened 

 slightly and significant improvements are anticipated in the future. 

 Investigations into collection-based health problems were multi- 

 plied to include : 



1. A study of avian orthopedics because existing fracture repair 

 techniques fall short of preventing shattering in weakened bones. 

 The techniques currently being tested consist of multiple pins and 

 external fracture fixation. 



2. A study of avian hematology to increase knowledge of the 

 sources of avian diseases, a field heretofore not well studied even 

 though species of birds represent the largest proportion of our col- 

 lection. Diagnostic techniques involving use of blood serum constitu- 

 ents have been virtually unknown in birds. The study thus far indi- 

 cates that white blood cell level might be an effective indicator of 

 infectious diseases which respond to antibiotic treatment. A paper 

 has been prepared and submitted for publication. 



Science 1 103 




3. A Tiger Virus Disease study has been started to isolate the viral 

 agent believed, as a result of tissue alterations identified through 

 light microscopy, to be the possible cause of white tiger cubs' deaths 

 earlier in the year. 



Studies continued into avian tuberculosis, selenium-vitamin E de- 

 ficiency, chromosome studies for taxonomic designation, sable blood, 

 reindeer metabolism, and the important area of establishing normal 

 blood values for exotic species. The office has cooperated in the de- 

 velopment of capture equipment and participated in field trials of 

 newly developed immobilizing agents. 



This unit has established a series of seminars for veterinarians on 

 the East Coast that are involved in exotic-animal medicine, and this 

 long-felt need for the improvement of exotic-animal medicine has 

 been well received by the participants. 



ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH 



The Office of Zoological Research, under Dr. John Eisenberg, 

 achieved notable progress on 24 projects in field mammalian ecology, 

 reproduction, behavioral analysis, and nutritional analysis. As one 

 arbitrary measure of success, 28 original contributions were pub- 

 lished in the department's six years of history to 1972, and 43 titles, 

 with 9 more now in press, since then. Nine graduate students and 

 two postdoctoral students from six universities were guided and 

 supported in 1974. 



Field efforts in the neotropics by Dr. G. C. Montgomery illumi- 

 nated the importance of the significant biomass contributions of the 

 three-toed sloth and of the lesser anteater, as well as to improving 

 chances for their eventual captive acclimatization. Other studies inte- 

 grated with the National Museum of Natural History and the Smith- 

 sonian Tropical Research Institute advanced with respect to a host 

 of rodent and primate species. 



Methods for scoring the behavior of female mammals as they pass 

 through estrus were developed by Dr. Devra Kleiman. Behavioral 

 changes associated with estrus in the tigress were published for the 

 first time. The role of olfaction as a mediator of reproductive behav- 

 ior in the binturong was published. The propagation of the golden 

 marmoset in the second generation was accomplished by Dr. Klei- 

 man and associated staff. The analysis of reproductive behavior of 

 the lesser panda and factors contributing to reproductive success in 



104 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




the giant panda were described. The reproductive behavior and cy- 

 cHng in the Indian rhinoceros was worked out by Dr. H. K. Buechner 

 and associates. Dr. Buechner also initiated a long-term study on the 

 determination of estrus and sexual behavior in the sable antelope. 



Studies on reproduction in caviomorph rodents have proceeded 

 in the Zoo collection resulting in the first establishment of captive 

 colonies of two — Octodontomys gliroides and Pediolagus salini- 

 cola — and the Zoo being in position to rear successfully two more. 

 The breeding of Carollia perspicillata, a species of fruit bat, was a 

 milestone study in the effective management of Chiropterans. 



Recognizing the importance of olfaction and the role of olfactory 

 signals in the priming and triggering of sexual behavior, several 

 rodent species have been explored by Dr. Michael Murphy, includ- 

 ing wild stocks of the golden hamster and three genera of cavio- 

 morph rodents. 



Aspects of animal communication, the genesis of social bonds, 

 and the structure of mammalian societies have been under intensive 

 investigation with self-evident applications to animal management. 

 For example, efforts in 1974 show that the success of second-genera- 

 tion breeding in the golden marmoset hinges upon an understanding 

 of the formation of social bonds and the role of early experience in 

 the participation of rearing young. Through analysis, such as are 

 currently being carried on in the Zoo and in parallel in the field, an 

 understanding and interpretation of communication in, for example, 

 the spider monkey now becomes possible. 



Dr. Eisenberg and his associates were deeply involved guiding the 

 success of the Thirteenth International Congress of Ethology held 

 in August with George Washington University and the Smith- 

 sonian Institution being the co-hosts. Scientists from many differ- 

 ent nations attended, resulting in an exciting exchange of stimulating 

 scientific information. 



CONSTRUCTION 



As mentioned previously the old Lion House has been demolished 

 and the new exhibit will begin construction early in July. The char- 

 acter of "lion house hill" is changing and for the definite advantage 

 of the big cats and their visiting public. The old Monkey House is 

 being renovated at this time and should be completed early in the 

 next calendar year. This house, built in 1904, will be modernized 



Science I 105 




to have 12 glass-fronted, larger inside exhibit cages and the corre- 

 sponding number of outside cages. The selection of monkeys will 

 be fewer than were exhibited before, but they will be in larger family 

 groups. The old, small-cat house generally referred to as the "puma 

 house" has been removed and plans are being prepared for its re- 

 placement by a series of free standing corn-crib-type cages to house 

 the lesser cats, such as pumas, lynx, and servals. The dog line below 

 the sea lion pool has also been removed with anticipated replacement 

 next year by fewer but larger compounds. 



Plans are proceeding for the renovation of the outside Elephant 

 House yards as well as of the outside cages around the Bird House. 

 New cheetah facilities are being presently constructed just north of 

 the sea lion pool. This will consist of spacious double enclosures 

 that will give the cheetahs a much larger area in which to run. This 

 will also allow separation of the males and females and it is hoped 

 will enable the establishment of a breeding program for these lovely 

 cats. In this vein the Zoo has secured, on breeding loan, a pair of 

 cheetahs from the Baltimore Zoo and a second pair from the Chey- 

 enne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs. Based on recent success of 

 cheetah breedings at the San Diego Zoo and Lion Country Safari, it 

 is hoped that a rotating encounter program can be established be- 

 tween the males and the females which will result in successful 

 breedings. 



VISITOR SERVICES 



In 1974, an effort was launched to bring progress in graphics, ex- 

 hibits, education, and information up to the pace now being set by 

 the Zoo's sound and progressive programs in animal management, 

 animal health, and zoological research. The Visitor Services Group, 

 led by an assistant director, assembled the Office of Graphics and 

 Exhibits, Education and Information, and the Protective Services 

 with the mission of providing the Zoo visitor good guidance and 

 opportunities for quality educational experiences, and a high degree 

 of public service and accommodation. This effort coordinates with 

 the Friends of the National Zoo as they continue to carry the Zoo's 

 educational programs to the visitors, to the local school systems, 

 and surrounding community. 



The information and education staffs are being increased, and 

 exhibits came under the control of an experienced and creative de- 



106 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




signer in order to bring the interpretive program up to highest stand- 

 ards. This person will also work closely with the designers, Wyman 

 and Cannon, Inc., contracted with under a matching grant from the 

 National Endowment for the Arts to develop a Master Graphics 

 Plan and Design Manual for the Zoo. 



Another important new service for both the employees and visi- 

 tors was the appointment of a Health and Safety Officer, with in- 

 creased emphasis on providing this vital area of visitor services. 



Management efforts in general in fiscal 1974 focused on building 

 up understanding and administrative capability at the level of the 

 operating offices assembled into the Animal Programs Group, Visi- 

 tor Services Group, and Central Services Group. Central manage- 

 ment was reduced to a handful of people working to help guide the 

 growth and progress of the ambitious and spirited Zoo staff. 



Office of International and Environmental Programs 



The new Office was established on October 15, 1973, combining the 

 Offices of International Activities and Environmental Sciences. It is 

 designed to further increase opportunities for the Smithsonian to 

 conduct research abroad through the application of its traditional 

 strengths in collection-based natural history to ecosystem-oriented 

 studies in the tropics. A new International Environmental Science 

 Program, incorporating the former programs in Oceanography, Lim- 

 nology, and Ecology, was initiated at the end of the fiscal year. The 

 previous program categories are used below to describe studies 

 conducted during 1973. 



The Office also continues to provide support to United States re- 

 search institutions, including the Smithsonian, through Foreign 

 Currency Program grants, and service to other Smithsonian units 

 through the Liaison Section of the International Activities Program. 



The Center for Short-Lived Phenomena, an independent unit of 

 the Office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, provides for the rapid com- 

 munication of technical data on natural and environmental phe- 

 nomena of short duration through a global network of scientific 

 correspondents. 



Wymberley Coerr, formerly Ambassador to Ecuador and Uruguay, 

 was appointed to head the new Office. 



Science 1 107 




A series of ecological assessment studies in foreign countries, ad- 

 ministered by the Office and supported by the Agency for Inter- 

 national Development, was completed during the year. The studies 

 included an analysis of the effect of oil pollution on marine orga- 

 nisms in Indonesia, a review of the environmental consequences of 

 rapid urbanization in a developing country (Seoul, Korea), and the 

 ecological impact of Lake Volta in Ghana, the world's largest man- 

 made lake. A 4-year study for the purpose of predicting the spread 

 of waterborne diseases, particularly schistosomiasis, with the im- 

 poundment of the Mekong River and its tributaries, was completed. 



OCEANOGRAPHY AND LIMNOLOGY PROGRAM 



During their combined 15 years of operations the Smithsonian's two 

 oceanographic sorting centers have processed bulk marine samples, 

 monitored and assessed marine pollution, and conducted baseline 

 and environmental prediction studies. In the past year, the centers 

 have processed more than 8 million specimens for specialists and 

 reference collections. Much of the material processed by the Oceano- 

 graphic Sorting Center in Washington involved Arctic and Antarctic 

 biological samples in cooperation with the nsf Office of Polar Pro- 

 grams. The biological and environmental data accompanying these 

 samples have been computerized. 



Over 3000 specimens at the Mediterranean Marine Sorting Cen- 

 ter have become a part of the Reference Collections of Mediterra- 

 nean Marine Biota. Sorted specimens are divided equally and 

 deposited in the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History 

 and the Institut National Scientifique et Technique d'Oceanographie 

 et de Peche. 



The Existing Conditions of the Biota of the Chesapeake Bay 

 Project for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is providing informa- 

 tion on the most important species of Chesapeake Bay, descriptions 

 of community structure, and analyses of water quality criteria. An 

 interim report was submitted in October, and the final report will 

 be submitted during the fiscal year 1975. Coordination responsibili- 

 ties of the report on the effects of Tropical Storm Agnes were also 

 performed for the Corps. 



The second year of a United States-Yugoslav aquatic study, en- 

 titled "Limnological Investigations of Lake Skadar," was success- 

 fully completed in cooperation with the Limnology Laboratory of 



108 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




the Biological Institut of Titograd. Extensive progress was made in 

 adequately equipping the laboratory and in sampling and analyzing 

 the preliminary research results. Manuscripts are in progress and 

 in press. 



Development of comprehensive biological studies of marine and 

 freshwater ecosystems in Egypt and Pakistan is proceeding. A post- 

 impoundment ecological assessment of the Nam Ngum Reservoir 

 in Laos was initiated in May 1974. 



Liaison with other Smithsonian Institution aquatic sciences was 

 continued, as was representation on various committees and coun- 

 cils concerned with oceanography and limnology. 



ECOLOGY PROGRAM 



An evaluation of environmental resources was undertaken in a study 

 for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in connection with the Corps' 

 responsibility for preserving natural, historical, and cultural aspects 

 of America's natural heritage. The project involved a comprehensive 

 review of current environmental inventories and literature on re- 

 quirements for such inventories, a critique of pilot environmental 

 reconnaissance inventories, and preparation of guidelines for agen- 

 cies conducting statewide inventories of critical environmental areas. 

 The guidebook deals with key issues and decisions that must be 

 resolved in conducting the inventories and suggests methodology 

 for delineating areas of critical environmental concern. 



The Smithsonian Center for Natural Areas assists, through eco- 

 logical studies, in planning and establishing priorities for the selec- 

 tion and preservation of ecologically significant areas. Natural areas 

 include habitats of threatened species of plants, animals, and com- 

 munities; important breeding and overwintering areas; sites of 

 unique interest for research or education interests; and archeological 

 and related locations that should be preserved. The Center has de- 

 veloped a quantitive evaluation technique of ecological indicators 

 as a scientifically valid basis of assigning priorities for acquisition of 

 permanent nature reserves by procuring agencies. 



The Center published a 2-year, natural-areas study of the Chesa- 

 peake Bay region. The Nature Conservancy, co-sponsor of the study, 

 intends to use the findings as one basis for procurement and desig- 

 nation as protected areas sites in the Chesapeake Bay watershed 

 regarded as ecologically significant.

The Center prepared an inventory of ecologically representative 

 sites within the Atlantic Coastal Region, together with descriptions 

 and recommendations to assist the National Park Service in desig- 

 nating sites for its Registry of Natural Landmarks. 



The Center is helping to assess the ecological consequences of 

 activities at U.S. Air Force Bases in the continental United States in 

 order to offer a scientific basis for suggesting improvements in con- 

 servation practices. A comprehensive survey was made for the Air 

 Force of the existing data on the flora and fauna of Johnston Atoll 

 in the Pacific, including both terrestrial and marine organisms. The 

 baseline information was compiled for an evaluation required for 

 an environmental impact statement for the islands. 



The Center for Natural Areas, with approval of the Smithsonian, 

 was incorporated as an independent organization during fiscal 1974. 

 The Center's studies henceforth will be supported by grants and 

 contracts from foundations, charitable trusts, federal, and state 

 agencies. 



The Smithsonian-Peace Corps Environmental Program provides 

 assistance in two general areas. It develops Peace Corps projects 

 and assignments dealing with environmental and natural resource 

 problems in the developing countries and recruits and places appli- 

 cants skilled in the environmental biological sciences. Over 700 

 applications were received in fiscal 1974, and 207 volunteers with 

 environmental skills were assigned to 28 countries. The volunteers 

 were requested directly by the host governments for assignment to 

 scientific and natural conservation programs. 



INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES PROGRAM 



As a part of the new Office of International and Environmental Pro- 

 grams, the International Activities Program has undergone no sub- 

 stantive changes in its functions. 



As its major responsibility, the International Activities Program 

 administers the Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program. This Pro- 

 gram awards grants to support the research interests of American 

 institutions, including the Smithsonian, in those countries where the 

 United States holds "excess" amounts of local currencies, derived 

 largely from sales of surplus agricultural commodities under Public 

 Law 480. Qualifying countries, where the Treasury Department 

 deems United States holdings of these currencies to be in excess of 



110 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




normal federal requirements, are presently India, Pakistan, Burma, 

 Egypt, Tunisia, Guinea, and Poland. The Smithsonian received a 

 fiscal 1974 appropriation of $4.5 million in "excess" currencies for 

 the support of grants in the disciplines of archeology and the anthro- 

 pological sciences, systematics and environmental biology, astro- 

 physics and the earth sciences, and museum-related fields. During 

 its first decade of operation, the Foreign Currency Program has 

 awarded more than $24 million in foreign currency grants to more 

 than 70 institutions in 32 states and the District of Columbia, in- 

 volving some 220 museums, universities, and research institutions. 

 Within the framework of the Program, the Smithsonian made ar- 

 rangements in fiscal 1974 for the United States to contribute $1 

 million in support of unesco efforts to save the submerged temples 

 at Philae, Egypt. The Program participated in interagency negotia- 

 tions leading to the establishment of a United States-Yugoslav Joint 

 Board of Scientific and Technical Cooperation. This Board makes it 

 possible to extend the period for which support will be available for 

 already approved United States-Yugoslav cooperative research proj- 

 ects, including Smithsonian research in limnology and Smithsonian 

 Foreign Currency-supported archeological research. 



The International Liaison Section continues to provide other 

 Smithsonian units with assistance in international matters involving 

 travel and projects abroad. It coordinated the travel and research 

 arrangements of the many foreign scholars visiting the Smithsonian, 

 and it makes arrangements for other foreign visitors. A growing 

 area of liaison responsibility is in special programs for foreign re- 

 search cooperation. These include promoting Smithsonian scientific 

 and scholarly cooperation with the People's Republic of China and 

 under binational arrangements with Israel and Germany. 



CENTER FOR SHORT-LIVED PHENOMENA 



The Center operates a worldwide electronic alert system for rapid 

 communication of scientific data on natural and environmental phe- 

 nomena of short duration. During the year the Center reported 155 

 short-lived events that occurred in 44 countries, islands, and ocean 

 areas. Scientific field teams investigated 120 of the events. The re- 

 porting network consists of about 2000 scientists, scientific research 

 institutions, and field stations located in 138 countries throughout 

 the globe. 



Science I 111 




Scientists and other subscribers to the Center's service receive in- 

 formation on significant changes in biological, ecological, and geo- 

 physical systems, including rare or unusual animal migrations, 

 population increases, and mortalities, major floods, forest fires, and 

 pollution events, such as oil and chemical spills, gas and radioactive 

 substance leaks, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides, and 

 occasional astrophysical events, such as meteorite falls and fireballs. 



The Center has enlarged its International Environmental Alert 

 Network to include more than 60,000 secondary school and univer- 

 sity students in over 800 schools throughout the United States and 

 Canada, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Rumania, Jor- 

 dan, Lebanon, Ghana, Korea, Singapore, Tanzania, Sudan, Sri 

 Lanka, South West Africa, England, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Cyprus, 

 Zambia, France, The Netherlands, and Kenya. 



Services under contract were provided to the United Nations En- 

 vironment Program; the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and 

 Cultural Organization; the United States National Aeronautic and 

 Space Administration; and the United States Environmental Protec- 

 tion Agency. 



Radiation Biology Laboratory 



The importance and significance of energy as the driving force of 

 our technological society became abundantly clear in 1974 as politi- 

 cal and economic forces displaced familiar use patterns. Thus, the 

 laboratory's charter "to study the role of sunlight in maintaining 

 life on the earth" anticipated current concerns by almost a half cen- 

 tury. In fact, the purposes and objectives of the laboratory become 

 increasingly important as the world's population grows, and its food 

 needs and requirements for diminishing fossil-fuel resources expand. 

 During fiscal 1974 the laboratory emphasized several major areas 

 of research on aspects of solar radiation that influence biological 

 systems: (1) measuring the solar energy received at the earth's sur- 

 face, its quantity, quality, and duration, since these parameters 

 establish the starting point for all aspects of photobiology; (2) the 

 biochemistry and biophysics of energy storage (photosynthesis) and 

 the structures (pigments and membrane systems) involved in cap- 



112 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




turing the sun's energy; (3) the regulation of the use of this stored 

 energy by Hving organisms in response to complex signals of light, 

 temperature, or gases in the environment; and (4) the use of the 

 photosynthetic products to date the time when objects of biological 

 origin were last alive and in equilibrium with the environment 

 (carbon dating). 



SOLAR ENERGY 



Measurements of solar energy were recorded from a monitoring 

 network including four locations: Barrow, Alaska; Flamenco Island, 

 Panama; the National Physical Laboratory in Jerusalem, Israel; and 

 at Rockville, Maryland. This network covers the Northern Hemi- 

 sphere reasonably well and records at three-minute intervals the 

 energy received in six color bands, as well as the total energy from 

 the ultraviolet short wavelength limit to the infrared (2.8 microns), 

 where the energy per photon is no longer capable of driving photo- 

 chemical reactions. 



From this enormous volume of data have been extracted many 

 useful pieces of information. For example, the area required for 

 suitable collectors to provide the necessary energy to heat or to air 

 condition buildings may be 'calculated or estimates of the upper 

 limits for plant growth in an area may be computed. 



In addition, some data implicate solar ultraviolet with skin cancer 

 incidence. Particularly, as more and more supersonic transport air- 

 craft are flown, it is postulated that the fuel exhausts will catalyze 

 the breakdown of the protective ozone screen in the atmosphere, 

 which limits the amount of ultraviolet penetrating to the earth's 

 surface. In cooperation with the Air Resources Laboratories of 

 NOAA, a scanning radiometer was stationed at Tallahassee, Florida. 

 This instrument measures narrow bandwidths of ultraviolet in the 

 erythemal (region of sunlight that causes skin reddening) band and 

 these data are being tested to see if a correlation exists between 

 quality and quantity received and the incidence of skin cancer (as 

 measured by the National Cancer Institute) in Tallahassee, 



Another important factor in solar irradiance measurements is the 

 primary standard to which all measurements are referred. The 

 Smithsonian has a long history of developing standards, and this 

 year a symposium was held for international authorities on solar 

 instruments and measurements to discuss and evaluate the initiation

 Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal. The units shown are pyranometers 

 mounted on the roof of the monitoring site. 



and worldwide use of a uniform and precisely defined measuring 

 scale. While there is, as yet, no consensus as to the best scale system, 

 at least intercomparison may now be made in a more rational man- 

 ner. The papers presented at this symposium will be published as a 

 Smithsonian publication. 



In order to pursue the importance of light on plant growth, four 

 large growth chambers were installed in which the major parameters 

 regulating plant growth can be controlled. These include the nutrient 

 and root media, the atmospheric media and the light environment. 

 Plants are grown on soil or artificial substrate systems (nutriculture). 



REGULATORY BIOLOGY 



Light in the environment also may regulate the rate of synthesis 

 of cell components or the rate of metabolism and growth of plant 

 parts. Such light signals must be absorbed by pigment molecules to 

 be effective. During the past year the laboratory has been isolating 

 and purifying the pigment ph'ytochrome. By hydrolyzing it in vari- 

 ous ways and determining the amino-acid composition of the various

 meter, an Abbot pyranometer, a modified Abbot pyranometer and an Abbot 

 silver disk pyrheliometer. The pyranometers are used to measure radiation 

 from the sun and sky while the pyrheliometers and the water-flow measure 

 only radiation from the sun (direct solar beam). 




peptides produced, information has been obtained about the mole- 

 cular weight and the chemical structure of this protein pigment. 



The phytochrome pigment was isolated from dark-grown rye seed- 

 lings. After purification, electrophoresis, and gel permeation chroma- 

 tography of the undenatured protein indicated a molecular weight 

 of about 400,000 daltons. Disc gel electrophoresis in detergents 

 indicated a principal product was formed with a molecular weight 

 of about 120,000 daltons. Cleavage of the protein was performed 

 with cyanogen bromide, which reacts with methionine residues. 

 This produced five peptides: one of 15,000 daltons, a chromopeptide 

 containing the light-absorbing portion (11,000 daltons), one about 

 8000 daltons, and two smaller ones. These data are consistent with 

 the 13S phytochrome being composed of one species of protomer 

 having a molecular weight of 42,000 and 4 methionine residues 

 per protomer. 



Another approach to the molecular function of phytochrome is 

 the determination of the dependence of physiological responses upon 

 the dose of light given. For a number of flowering plants, such as 

 peas and mustard, dose-response curves were determined, as well 

 as changes in the dose-response curves following sequential expo- 

 sures to light. In addition, the capacity for rapid chlorphyll accumu- 

 lation was measured. Data indicate that the physiologically active 

 form of phytochrome produced by the first red exposure migrates 

 to a membrane surface, which results in more light being required 

 for a given response. But once light is absorbed, it is more effective 

 because the active molecule is already attached to a membrane in- 

 volved in the response. 



For photosynthesis to occur efficiently, the incident sunlight must 

 be absorbed in all wavelength regions. Algae have solved this prob- 

 lem by forming special pigment protein complexes known as phyco- 

 bilisomes. These complexes trap the light energy and transfer it to 

 a "reaction center," where it is used to produce energy-rich com- 

 pounds. Phycobilisomes can be isolated and then dissociated into 

 their component parts. A model has been developed this year that 

 describes at the molecular level the spatial arrangement of at least 

 four pigments involved and their attachment to the photosynthetic 

 membranes. 



The chloroplasts of higher plants also trap light energy and 

 convert it to chemical energy. Formation of chloroplasts and the 



116 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




maintenance of chloroplast structure is a fascinating problem that is 

 attracting considerable attention. Making the proteins for a func- 

 tional chloroplast requires cooperation between nuclear and chloro- 

 plast genetic systems. That is, the genetic material for and the 

 synthesis of certain chloroplast proteins are located in the nucleus 

 and cytoplasm respectively, while the genetic material for and the 

 synthesis of other chloroplast proteins are located in the chloroplast. 

 Part of the chloroplast protein synthesis occurs on chloroplast 

 photosynthetic membranes. 



During the past year, a system was developed in which biosyn- 

 thesis of chloroplast photosynthetic membranes could be studied in 

 vitro. In actively growing cells of the alga Chlamydomonas, a large 

 portion of chloroplast ribosomes exists attached to the photosyn- 

 thetic membranes. Electron micrographs of isolated membranes show 

 that some of the ribosomes are bound as polyribosomes. When the 

 membranes are dissolved by detergent, these polyribosomes can be 

 recovered and account for more than half of the ribosomes bound to 

 the membranes. These results suggest that the membrane-ribosome 

 association functions in protein synthesis, because polysomes occur 

 when active protein synthesis takes place. This assumption was 

 confirmed by the finding that the isolated membrane-ribosome 

 association will carry out protein synthesis. This protein synthesis 

 reaction depends on the presence of the ribosomes attached to the 

 membranes. It is inhibited by chloramphenicol, not by cyclohexi- 

 mide, as is expected for protein synthesis by chloroplast ribosomes. 

 The protein synthesis reaction requires an energy generation system 

 and a soluble cell extract. The reaction is inhibited by ribonuclease. 

 These properties indicate that the protein synthesis reaction is car- 

 ried out by the isolated membranes. 



Blue light regulates the biosynthesis of yellow pigments, such as 

 the vitamin A precursor, ^-carotene. At least eight different caro- 

 tenoids are synthesized after light exposure of dark-grown mycelial 

 pads of the bread mold Neurospora crassa. The photoinduction of 

 these pigments can be divided into at least three phases : (a) a rapid 

 light reaction, (b) a period of protein synthesis, and (c) accumulation 

 of the carotenoid pigment. 



The effect of temperature on these processes has been studied 

 this year. The light reaction, of course, is temperature-independent, 

 but synthesis immediately following light exposure has an optimum 



Science 1 117 




near 6°C. These data, as well as studies with inhibitors of protein 

 synthesis, indicate that the light reaction produces an inducer that 

 activates a gene. The genetic code in the activated gene specifies the 

 amino-acid sequence of an enzyme required for carotenoid biosyn- 

 thesis. This enzyme is apparently absent in dark-grown cultures. 

 Furthermore, physiological evidence indicates that the inducer is 

 lost from the carotenoid-synthesizing system in a temperature- 

 dependent competitive reaction. 



In addition, four different types of mutant strains of Neurospora 

 were produced from wild type by uv light: albinos, which do not 

 make pigment even in the presence of light; yellow-orange mutants, 

 which synthesize a different distribution of pigments; mutants in 

 which the sensitivity of carotenoid synthesis to temperatures above 

 6°C has been reduced; and mutants which can make pigment in the 

 dark. 



The activities of many enzymes in organisms from bacteria to 

 man appear to be under the control of cyclic-AMP (adenosine mono- 

 phosphate). For example, in man the hormones epinephrine or glu- 

 cagon stimulate the synthesis of cyclic-AMP, which in turn activates 

 a series of enzymes required for starch breakdown. Evidence has 

 been obtained that animal cells that have been transformed by a 

 virus to cancerous cells have lower than normal cyclic-AMP levels. 

 There is evidence in frogs and rats that light controls the level of 

 cyclic-AMP. We have obtained evidence that such a control system 

 exists in Neurospora and may be part of the mechanism for photo- 

 induction of carotenoid synthesis. Since cyclic-AMP probably regu- 

 lates the activities of many different enzymes in Neurospora, then 

 control of the level of cyclic-AMP by light should regulate a number 

 of biochemical pathways besides carotenoid synthesis. Such a control 

 mechanism can be conveniently studied in Neurospora and the 

 results used to predict the type of control system that operates in 

 higher organisms. 



ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY 



Light acts not only as a carrier of information for regulating metabo- 

 lism but is also absorbed and stored as chemical energy, along with 

 the production of oxygen as a byproduct (photosynthesis). If leaves 

 of plants are exposed to low temperatures (chilling), there is an 

 inhibition in the rate of fixation of carbon dioxide. In addition, the 



118 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




oxygen-evolving power of leaves after cold storage is regulated by 

 mangano-protein in the chloroplast thylakoids. Since a great deal of 

 the world's agriculture and the distribution of wild plant populations 

 are limited by temperature, it is important to determine the portion 

 of the photosynthetic mechanism directly affected by chilling. 

 Plants that were grown under very warm conditions (30 °C) were 

 exposed to a succession of days and nights of cool (10°C day, S^C 

 night) temperatures, and the ability of whole leaves to take up 

 carbon dioxide was measured. Within 24 hours after exposure to 

 low temperature, the plants' capacity to take up carbon dioxide at 

 warm temperatures was reduced by about 25 percent. Longer expo- 

 sure to low temperature brings with it further reduction in carbon 

 assimilation. 



The process of photosynthesis involves considerably more than 

 carbon dioxide assimilation, and in order to determine which of the 

 many steps is affected by changes in temperature, a partitioning of 

 the process was attempted. Photosynthetic cells from the leaf were 

 separated from the remaining nonphotosynthetic tissue. Active 

 whole cells were obtained which retain the capacity to evolve oxygen 

 using light. Exposure of plants to chilling temperatures, however, 

 does not consistently affect the capacity of cells extracted from these 

 plants to evolve oxygen. Sometimes there is a substantial reduction 

 in oxygen evolution and sometimes only minor change. The reason 

 for this variability is as yet unknown. 



Measurements have been made of the total productive capacity 

 for communities of plants in a salt marsh in the Chesapeake Bay. 

 It has been assumed that salt marshes contribute substantially to 

 their neighboring estuaries and are consequently essential to the 

 maintenance of life in the estuaries. Assimilated carbon in the marsh 

 is exported to the estuary; however, most data for this assumption 

 are based upon an incomplete examination of the capacity of the 

 marsh to take up and metabolize carbon! A plastic chamber to 

 enclose a section of the marsh community has been constructed in 

 conjunction with a continuous flow, infrared, gas-analysis system 

 to monitor the net carbon dioxide exchange over the marsh com- 

 munity. 



In addition to net carbon dioxide exchange, a method has been 

 evaluated for determining the amount of green matter in a marsh 

 without the necessity of destroying any of the community being

studied. The method depends upon the fact that green plants reflect 

 red light less than they reflect far-red radiation (light that is at and 

 just beyond the sensitivity of the human eye). The seasonal change 

 in reflectance of these two bands of light was found to change as 

 the total amount of green matter in the stand of plants changed. 

 This method was originally developed to study productivity of 

 prairie communities, but the method appears to work in marshes. 

 A correlation was found between the reflectance measurements and 

 direct measurements of biomass obtained by cutting and weighing 

 samples. Thus, a rapid, nondestructive assay of growth in marshes 

 can be obtained. The method also has the advantage that the equip- 

 ment is portable and, thus, usable in remote locations. 



The growth of plants in an estuarine environment is sometimes 

 limited by phosphorus cycling in the tidal environment. Phosphorus 

 flux rates and phosphorus cycling in situ in the tidal marsh, mud 

 flat periphyton, and plankton communities of the Rhode River sub- 

 estuary of Chesapeake Bay were measured. Techniques employed 

 included phosphorus-32-orthophosphate uptake and chase kinetics.

Current concept of the pathways of estuarine plankton phosphorus cycling. 

 Processes stopped by enclosing a sample in a bottle are indicated as dashed

analysis of specific and total activity in various metabolically mean- 

 ingful phosphorus fractions, detailed chromatographic fractionation, 

 continuous-flow pulse-labeling of plankton, direct microscopic 

 examination of microbial communities, and phosphorus-33 micro- 

 autoradiography. From these data the major pathways of phosphorus 

 cycling in estuarine plankton were constructed. The heavy arrows 

 are believed to be main pathways. Microbiological data, as well as 

 the size classing and inhibitor data, support this picture. Thus, 

 orthophosphate is taken up mostly by bacteria that are mainly on 

 the surfaces of suspended sediments and detritus, but phytoplankton 

 also take up some orthophosphate in the light. The bacteria and 

 phytoplankton are then eaten by filter feeders, especially ciliate 

 protozoans. These in turn release most of the phosphorus as dis- 

 solved orthophosphate and organic phosphorus. 



In addition, the phosphorus cycling in a deciduous forest when 

 subjected to various levels of mineral nutrient loading was measured. 

 Phosphorus loading of the leaf-litter zone beneath beech trees in 

 Maryland was varied from the "natural" level (3 to 12 mg P.m~^* 

 day~^) to 430 mg P.m~^*day~^ above the natural level. Phosphorus- 

 32 was used to measure rates and to determine pathways of phos- 

 phorus cycling. Upon increased loading, the phosphorus content of \ 

 the litter increased fourfold and then stabilized. When this loading 

 was discontinued, the phosphorus content of the litter declined to 

 the original level. Phosphorus not assimilated by the leaf litter 

 moved rapidly through the soil both vertically and horizontally. 

 Forest trees obtained most of their phosphorus from the litter zone. 



Sometimes the effects of a sudden dramatic changes in energy 

 flow in the environment can be assayed. Such a dynamic stress 

 occurred in tropical storm Agnes. Although the storm center cir- 

 cumnavigated the Rhode River estuary, the salinity reached a 

 minimum about two weeks later because of flooding by the Susque- 

 hanna River. This event was coincident with the year's highest water 

 temperature (30-31 °C) and resulted in severe mortalities in the ' 

 biota. Periphyton (attached microbial communities) experienced a 

 nearly complete die-off. High levels of sediments and of nutrients, 

 especially nitrate and total- phosphorus, were delivered to Rhode 

 River by the bay proper and from local runoff. These nutrients 

 were deposited in Rhode River bottom sediments. This reservoir 

 released nutrients a year later, especially at a time of low dissolved 



122 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




oxygen in the bottom water and of intensive dinoflagellate blooms. 

 In a 13-day period it is estimated that over 900 Kg phosphorus was 

 released from the bottom sediments. Thus, even though the effects 

 were indirect from tropical storm Agnes, they were large. 



CARBON DATING 



Because all living things are in equilibrium with the carbon dioxide 

 in the atmosphere, and this equilibrium is fixed at the time of death, 

 with the radioactive carbon^'* gradually decaying away as the sample 

 ages, it is possible to determine the age of biological specimens back 

 to about 40,000 years by measuring their radioactive carbon^'* con- 

 tent. From data taken from the remains and artifacts of archaic 

 populations, it is possible to explore the relationships between 

 changing environments and changing cultures. 



I From such artifacts a chronological framework is being con- 

 structed for populations in North America. In cooperation with 

 anthropologists, geologists, and palynologists the time period 6000 

 B.c to 2000 B.C. has been examined for northeastern North America. 

 f Of particular interest is the date of entry of man into the New 

 World. In cooperation with the University of Alaska, dating of 

 ■selected archeological and geological sites discovered during con- 

 } struction of the Alaska pipeline have been accomplished. Recent 

 [findings published by the Scripps Institution, using the determina- 

 I tion of racemic mixtures of aspartic acid, indicate that man was 

 i present in North America at least 50,000 years before the present. 

 [However, dates from the North Slope in our laboratory confirm 

 ' occupation of more than 10,000 years ago. 



Thus, the requirement for more energy to drive our technology 

 that resulted in the need for the Alaska pipeline has yielded as a 

 secondary scientific benefit an indication of man's early history in 

 the New World. 



PUBLIC SERVICE 



Lectures and invited symposium talks were presented by the staff 

 to more than 30 research institutions and universities, both nation- 

 ally and internationally. Hundreds of reprints of published data 

 were distributed to interested professional colleagues, and several 

 staff members taught seminars and courses in their professional 

 specialties. 



Science I 123 




Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory 



On July 1, 1973, the Smithsonian Institution and Harvard University 

 established at Cambridge, Massachusetts, a Center for Astrophysics 

 to coordinate the related research activities of the Smithsonian 

 Astrophysical Observatory (sao) and the Harvard College Observa- 

 tory (hco) under a single director. 



At that time, George B. Field, Professor of Astronomy at Harvard 

 University, became the director of the joint facility and of both 

 observatories, succeeding Fred L. Whipple of sao and Alexander i 

 Dalgarno of hco. | 



The creation of this new consolidated science program, drawing • 

 on the resources of the Smithsonian Institution and Harvard Univer- 

 sity to achieve scientific excellence, is both a response to the new 

 research goals and opportunities of the present and a reflection of 

 traditional ties of the past. 



During the past decade, astrophysics has experienced an explosion 

 of ideas. New windows on the universe have been opened by the 

 discovery of radiation in unexpected bands of the electromagnetic 

 spectrum. And the expanded use of rocket, balloon, and satellite 

 experiments has allowed observation of this radiation from above 

 the earth's obscuring atmosphere. Gamma rays. X-rays, ultraviolet 

 light, and infrared radiation are all now observed almost as routinely 

 as radio and visible waves. Each new spectrum window has revealed 

 a vast and varied universe filled with objects defying the imagina- 

 tion: quasars, pulsars. X-ray and gamma-ray stars, black holes, and 

 neutron stars, as well as massive interstellar clouds of dust particles 

 and complex molecules. 



When it was founded by Samuel Pierpont Langley in 1890, the 

 goal of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory was the increase 

 and diffusion of knowledge about the earth and its immediate as- 

 tronomical environment. This goal remains unchanged today; how- 

 ever, the technological developments in observational techniques 

 and data analysis, coupled with unusual advances in theoretical 

 astronomy, now allow Smithsonian scientists to expand their 

 astronomical horizons to the very edge of the universe. 



Two major scientific problems are at the core of this expanded 

 astronomical research program. The first is the evolution of matter, 

 starting with the explosive beginning of the universe some 20 billion 



124 / Smithsonian Year 1974

years ago. After the formation of galaxies and stars, some matter 

 collapsed into those exotic and unusual objects known as quasars, 

 neutron stars, and black holes. 



i The extreme physical conditions existing in these objects severely 

 test all the fundamental principles of modern physics. Obviously, 

 the evolutionary processes forming stars and galaxies hold clues 

 to how the universe began — and how it may end! 



The second problem concerns the cosmic matter that has cooled 

 sufficiently for molecules and solid particles to form. The conden- 

 sation of materials accompanying the formation of stars like our 

 own sun apparently results in the formation of planets and the 

 eventual emergence of life. Through continued studies of this matter 

 in space, as well as of the sun, planets, and earth, sao scientists 

 seek to understand the processes that led to the origin of life in the 

 universe. 



The solution of these two problems in modern astronomy can be 

 achieved only through the concerted efforts of a variety of investi- 

 gators using a diversity of approaches. For example, the study of 

 matter under extreme conditions can be approached through high- 

 energy astrophysics, solar and stellar physics, or optical astronomy; 

 while the study of solid particles can be approached through infra- 

 red and radio astronomy, planetary sciences or geoastronomy. 

 Theoretical and laboratory studies underlie each approach. Each 

 approach also requires quite different research tools, ranging from 

 rocket, balloon, and satellite detectors for gamma-ray and X-ray 

 astronomy, to shock-tube and radiation laboratories and computers 

 for molecular and atomic physics. 



The complexity of modern astronomical research thus demands 

 the consolidation of efforts whenever possible. The Center for 

 Astrophysics is designed for this purpose — to draw on the differ- 

 ent strengths of the Smithsonian and Harvard observatories. The 

 once loose groupings of scientists and projects are now concentrated 

 in eight divisions representing the major approaches to the dual 

 problems of cosmic evolution and life in the universe. 



ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR PHYSICS 



The laboratory and theoretical program of this division are closely 

 related to other experimental and observational programs at the 

 Center. Specifically, this group is concerned with the chemical re- 



Science / 125 




actions occurring in planetary atmospheres and interstellar clouds 

 Major efforts include the development of model potential methods ;| 

 in theoretical atomic physics, the calculation of atomic transition 

 probabilities, and the application of laser techniques to atomic and 

 molecular spectroscopy. The measurements resulting from the 

 spectroscopic research will play a critical role in the interpretation 

 of data returned from other Center space programs. 



CEOASTRONOMY 



This division continues sao's long-term program to study earth 

 dynamics, the upper atmosphere, and earth's gravitational field. 



In cooperation with scores of other organizations around the 

 world, the earth dynamics program is building the large data base 

 necessary to define the kinematics, bulk dynamics, and mass distri- 

 bution of the earth. The program depends heavily on sao's sophisti- 

 cated laser and camera satellite-tracking network, supported by the 

 National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 



The upper atmospheric research program uses computer analysis 

 of the anomalies in satellite orbits to develop accurate models of 

 the earth's gravity field and to define the forces exerted by both 

 sunshine and earthshine. 



A gravitational redshift project will utilize an extremely accurate, 

 rocket-borne, maser clock, paired with a similar ground-based 

 instrument, to test the equivalence principle of Einstein's Theory 

 of Relativity in the gravitational field of the earth. 



HIGH-ENERGY ASTROPHYSICS 



The Center is emerging as a national leader in the field of high- 

 energy astronomy, and particularly X-ray research, through its 

 participation in the NASA-sponsored series of high-energy astronomi- 

 cal observatories (head). Major efforts are directed toward con- 

 struction and planning of experiments aboard the heao-b, now 

 scheduled for launch in 1975 as the first true space observatory 

 capable of high angular resolution X-ray observations. This satellite 

 will permit the first studies of the X-ray structure of extended objects 

 and complex sources. In the meantime, the division continues its 

 analysis of data obtained by-UHURU satellite, the pioneering experi- 

 ment in this field. This effort has led to the first identification of a 

 probable "black hole" in the constellation Cygnus. 



126 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




Ground-based observations at Mt. Hopkins have led to the detec- 

 tion of gamma-ray emissions from the Crab Nebula. 



I OPTICAL AND INFRARED ASTRONOMY 



This division's activities fall in four related areas : studies of infrared 

 emissions from galaxies and H II regions; studies of the spectra of 

 stars and circumstellar materials; analysis of the spectra of inter- 

 stellar materials and planetary atmospheres; and optical studies of 

 emission from X-ray sources and pulsars. Observations are made 

 with Center instruments at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona; Agassiz Station, 

 Massachusetts; and Boy den Station, South Africa; as well as with 

 instruments at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, Arizona, and 

 the Hale Observatories, California, and their respective Southern 

 Hemisphere installations at Cerro Tololo and Las Campanas, Chile. 

 The Harvard component of these observing programs is supported 

 by the National Science Foundation (nsf). 



This division's observational capabilities will be greatly enhanced 

 by the addition of a large telescope of revolutionary design. This 

 multiple-mirror telescope (mmt) combines six 72-inch mirrors in a 

 hexagonal array around a central core to produce an instrument with 

 the light-gathering capacity of a conventional 176-inch telescope. 

 The MMT is now under construction jointly by sao and the University 

 of Arizona. 



PLANETARY SCIENCES 



Traditionally, sao has been a recognized leader in the study of the 

 smaller bodies of the solar system. Vigorous programs involving 

 geochemical and petrological analyses of lunar and meteoritical 

 samples continue, as does the remote sensing of planets, satellites, 

 and asteroids, largely supported by nasa. 



Observations of comets, combined with computer analyses of 

 their orbits and laboratory studies of their physical properties, also 

 continue. During the past year, the Center served as a major clearing- 

 house for information related to the international program to observe 

 and study Comet Kohoutek. Theoretical work in this field is being 

 supported through Harvard by nsf. 



RADIO ASTRONOMY 

 The Center's radio astronomy program results from the strong 



Science 1 127 




efforts begun at the Harvard College Observatory with nsf support. 

 It includes capability in both the centimeter and the millimeter 

 wavelength bands of the radio spectrum. Laboratory facilities sup- 

 port the observational program by measuring properties of spectral 

 lines in these wavelengths. This combined effort has identified sev- 

 eral new interstellar molecules. 



A cooperative program continues with the University of Texas 

 to conduct observations in the 2- and 3-millimeter wavelength 

 bands. 



SOLAR AND STELLAR PHYSICS 



The Center's unusually strong program in this field is founded on 

 the observational data provided by the Harvard solar satellite pro- 

 gram and the theoretical work done by sao scientists in the develop- 

 ment of model stellar atmospheres. The extensive data produced 

 by the Harvard experiment aboard nasa's Skylab satellite should 

 provide the basis for several years of analysis and interpretation 

 leading to a new understanding of the energy-generation processes 

 in the outer layers of the sun. The broad range of SAO-developed 

 computer programs and theoretical techniques is being applied to 

 the interpretation of ultraviolet solar and stellar observations, both 

 from Skylab and other satellites such as Copernicus. In addition, 

 the successful flight of a balloon-mounted 40-inch infrared telescope 

 in early 1974 demonstrated the feasibility of further large-aperture 

 flights for broadband photometry and mapping, multiband and 

 galactic sources. This project was a joint venture of sao, hco, and 

 the University of Arizona. 



THEORETICAL ASTROPHYSICS 



If the Center is distinguished by its broad spectrum of astrophysical 

 problems under investigation, then it is the theoretical effort that 

 serves as the catalyst encouraging active and fruitful interrelation- 

 ships among different approaches to similar problems. Thus, the 

 objectives of this division are to establish and maintain expertise 

 in those areas of physics underlying the applications to astrophysics, 

 to create active research areas along a broad front, and to alert the 

 Center staff of new directions in astrophysics. Most important, 

 perhaps, this division plays a major role in the Center's commitment 

 to astronomy education: identifying, encouraging, and training new 



128 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




iastronomers, as well as bringing talented students and younger pro- 

 fessionals into its research program. Much of this division's effort 

 is also supported by nsf. 



The pooling of Smithsonian and Harvard scientific resources in 

 a Center for Astrophysics seems an appropriately modern and 

 rational adaptation to the times. Oddly enough, it is more the natural 

 evolution of the long relationship between the two organizations. 

 Since 1955, when the headquarters of sao moved to the grounds of 

 the Harvard College Observatory in Cambridge, the two observa- 

 tories have pursued astronomical research in close collaboration, 

 with many members of the Smithsonian staff holding joint appoint- 

 ments at Harvard and using University-owned facilities. 



The ties between Harvard and Smithsonian, however, reach back 

 into the nineteenth century, when Harvard alumnus and United 

 States President John Quincy Adams urged both his alma mater 

 and his Congress to establish jointly an astronomical observatory 

 to serve the nation, preferably under the aegis of the Smithsonian 

 Institution. 



Echoing this call for joint academic-government action, Joseph 

 Henry, first Secretary of the Institution, later urged that any observ- 

 atory established by the Smithsonian should be "closely connected 

 with some well-endowed and well-established college or university." 



Nearly a century and a half have passed, but the dreams of both 

 Joseph Henry and John Quincy Adams are finally realized in the 

 Center for Astrophysics. This cooperative venture has great impli- 

 cations for the future, not only because it may serve as a guide for 

 other similar pairings of private and public institutions, but also 

 because the basic goals it pursues must surely affect all aspects of 

 human life — from genetics to energy production. 



Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc. 



This year has been an important one for the Smithsonian Science 

 Information Exchange (ssie) as it actively began its efforts to move 

 from a national center for information about ongoing research to one 

 more international in terms of coverage and use of its services. The 

 Exchange, which has provided services to foreign users over the 



Science 1 129 




years, has now begun to seek and include input on research in 

 progress overseas in a more concerted way, while at the same time ! 

 it has also increased its coverage at the national level. 



Many of the problems now confronting our own government are I 

 of equal concern to other countries, and these new national priorities 

 require a knowledge of ongoing research in other countries as well. 

 Such information will ultimately be available through the Exchange > 

 as present plans to increase its coverage develop over the next few I 

 years. Efforts to increase coverage in such major areas as agricultural 

 research, cancer, energy and environmental research are already 

 underway, supported by both federal and nonfederal organizations 

 as well as through the help of both national and international 

 organizations. 



The Exchange is presently exploring all feasible ways for collect- 

 ing or developing access to a comprehensive record of worldwide 

 scientific and technical research and development work in progress 

 and to exercise vigorous United States leadership in creating a sys- 

 tem for storing and exchanging such information with initial efforts 

 directed toward those programs of primary national interest. These 

 are at least seven data bases of ongoing research currently in exist- 

 ence in other countries and many others are being developed. Input 

 or exchange from these as well as selected input in specialized areas 

 of interest from other countries will enhance the value of the 

 Exchange's data base to both scientists and research managers in 

 the United States. Many of the systems currently in existence are 

 based on systems that were developed along the lines of the 

 Exchange's system following visits to the ssie. Compatibility between 

 systems will be encouraged wherever possible to facilitate exchange 

 of information. 



As a consequence of its efforts in the fiscal year 1974, the Ex- 

 change has increased foreign input and established methods for 

 increased use of the Exchange by foreign scientists. To illustrate 

 the latter, an agreement has been reached with the Institute for 

 Documentation in the Federal Republic of Germany which will 

 provide support for the use of ssie services by a large number of 

 German scientists over an initial one-year period. The project will 

 provide an opportunity for. a large number of German research 

 investigators to observe firsthand the value of learning before publi- 

 cation what their colleagues in the United States are doing in areas 



130 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




of research closely paralleling their own efforts. It may also expedite 

 development of similar systems such as ssie in Germany as well as 

 lead to more cooperative efforts on problems of similar interest and 

 an exchange of ongoing research information. 



The Exchange has continued to explore and implement techniques 

 for increased utilization of its information by coupling it with biblio- 

 graphic information including both scientific journal literature and 

 technical reports. These efforts include the use of publications con- 

 taining the combined information as well as coupling of information 

 obtained directly from the ssie data base with that from other 

 information systems, thus providing users of such material with the 

 latest in both published and ongoing research information. Discus- 

 sions have taken place with several Federal data-base systems to 

 expand this approach and offer remote on-line searches of selected 

 portions of the Exchange's data base. 



Considerable progress has been made in the development and 

 testing of a new machine-aided indexing system. This system, which 

 was designed to help the Exchange's staff of professional scientists 

 and engineers cope with the increasing volume of information com- 

 ing into the Exchange, will also be of interest and value to other 

 information systems of a similar nature. The system is not intended 

 to replace the scientific expertise necessary for maintaining a high 

 quality of indexing but rather complements it by picking up routine 

 terms that are readily identifiable, freeing the scientists to concen- 

 trate on the more important aspect of conceptual indexing. Publica- 

 tion of the technique will be made following more extensive testing 

 of the system in the coming year. This project is another example 

 of the Exchange's continuing effort in research and development 

 designed not only to improve the ssie's system but make such 

 developments available by publication for use throughout the infor- 

 mation community. 



The Exchange as a result of offering new services and expanding 

 previously available ones has shown an increase in use in fiscal 1974 

 primarily as a result of making more scientists aware of the Ex- 

 change's services. The response by many users to the Exchange's 

 Newsletter has been excellent in terms of increased subscriptions 

 and products ordered through this organ. The Exchange's continu- 

 ing user-evaluation program indicates that it is providing a highly 

 useful and important service. The Exchange has also developed 



Science 1 131 




closer liaison with Federal agencies to increase their utilization of 

 ssiE services in the management of their own research programs 

 particularly in areas of high national interest. 



Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute 



This year marked a change in the administration of the Smithsonian 

 Tropical Research Institute. Dr. Martin H. Moynihan, in order to 

 devote his full time to research, resigned to become a senior scientist 

 at the Institute after directing this bureau for 16 years. During this 

 period he guided stri's growth from a biological preserve and small 

 field camp on Barro Colorado Island to a research institute with a 

 worldwide reputation. During Dr. Moynihan's tenure the permanent 

 professional staff increased from 1 to 15, and the geographic scope 

 of their investigations extended from Barro Colorado Island and 

 the surrounding forests to adjacent areas of Central and South 

 America, and then to intertropical comparisons in Gabon, Ceylon, 

 India, Madagascar, Malaya, and New Guinea. Moynihan supported 

 a program of student fellowship at both the pre- and post-doctoral 

 level and encouraged a steadily increasing number of scientific 

 visitors from around the world. 



The research of the institute's staff closely reflects the depth and 

 diversity of Dr. Moynihan's own scientific interests, which in the 

 last 15 years have ranged from the behavior, evolution, and ecology 

 of such diverse groups as birds, primates, and cephalopods. Research 

 on the latter group was facilitated by the development of a marine 

 research program and stri marine laboratories on both the Atlantic 

 and Pacific coasts of Panama. 



Ira Rubinoff was appointed the new Director, and A. Stanley 

 Rand has assumed the responsibilities of Assistant Director of stri. 



The development of stri research program was paralleled by an 

 increase in facilities and support staff. These include, new animal- 

 keeping facilities, air-conditioned laboratories, sea-water systems, 

 research vessels, and an excellent tropical biology library, which 

 now includes over 14,000 volumes and served approximately 4000 

 patrons in fiscal 1974. 



Research at stri continue? to be primarily concerned with basic 



132 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




scientific questions of the evolutionary and ecological adaptations 

 of tropical organisms. 



Two new scientists joined our staff in the fiscal year 1974. Olga F. 

 Linares is an anthropologist studying human paleoecological proc- 

 esses and contemporary subsistence adaptations to the American 

 and African tropics. Alan P. Smith, a plant ecologist, has accepted a 

 joint appointment with stri and the University of Pennsylvania. He 

 will examine the physiological adaptations to seasonality of plants 

 on Barro Colorado Island. 



Scientists at stri continued their studies concerning a variety of 

 organisms. 



R. L. Dressier spent several weeks in field work in Mexico study- 

 ing orchids and their pollinators. He published two books: Orqui- 

 deas de las Americas (with Mariano Ospina H.), the first general 

 reference book on American orchids in Spanish, and The Genus 

 Encyclia in Mexico (with Glenn E. Pollard), the first detailed treat- 

 ment of that group. A Spanish edition of the latter volume will be 

 published shortly. 



Pollination of Polycynis barbata by Eulaema speciosa. When the male bee 

 lands on the lip to gather the perfume, its weight pulls the flower down and 

 the curved column touches the dorsal surface of the bee, depositing pollen. 

 Pollination results if the bee already carried pollen from another flower. 



Science 1 133 




The history of coral reefs off both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts 

 of Panama are being investigated by Peter Glynn and his associates. 

 They are taking core samples through the reefs in order to determine 

 the age of the reefs and their species composition at different levels. 

 Reefs in Panama have been found to be about 6000 years old. Over 

 the past 1000 years significant changes in coral populations have 

 occurred on a Caribbean fringe reef, but the causes of these changes 

 are not presently known. 



J. Graham studied the diving capability of the sea snake Pelamis 

 platurus, which is common along the Pacific Coast of Panama, and 

 found that while the snake has some of the typical adaptations found 

 among vertebrate divers, it can also respire aquatically. J, H. Gee 

 of the University of Manitoba spent a sabbatical year at stri and 

 collaborated with Graham and F. S. Robison in a study of buoyancy 

 adjustment during diving of sea snakes. 



E. Leigh took a field trip to the Amazon region of Peru to con- 

 tinue his comparative studies of the structure of tropical forests. 



M. Moynihan and A. Rodaniche have continued their studies on 

 the social behavior of the Caribbean squid Sepioteuthis sepioidea 

 and have begun observations on a number of Pacific Ocean cephalo- 

 pods. M. Moynihan has completed his book The New World Pri- 

 mates, which should be published shortly. 



A. S. Rand continues his analysis of the displays of species of 

 Anolis. He began to develop the first animated lizard display film, 

 which will provide a tool for dissecting displays into their compo- 

 nents and analyzing the functional aspects of these components. 



Michael and Barbara Robinson continued studies of the ecology 

 and behavior of tropical spiders. They investigated the ontogeny of 

 predatory behavior in orb-web spiders, demonstrated by deprivation 

 experiments that the spiders' ability to discriminate between certain 

 types of prey is not dependent on previous experience and is, there- 

 fore, not learned. In New Guinea, the Robinsons resumed studies of 

 the defensive behavior of the rich orthopteroid fauna of the island. 

 The latter studies suggest that the evolution of defensive behavior in 

 these insects has been strongly influenced by the presence of a 

 unique assemblage of predatory nocturnal marsupials. 



R. Rubinoff continues her studies of the behavior of the sea 

 urchin Diadema antillarum and has succeeded in demonstrating a 

 social component to their "clumping" behavior.

Virtually all of the Swainson's Hawks in the United States pass 

 through Panama during migration, as do large numbers of other 

 North American hawks and vultures. By photographing the sky 

 along the migration routes, Neal Smith has begun to evaluate the 

 abundance and population characteristics of these hawks. These data 

 should provide a useful index of the environmental quality of the 

 North American nesting areas of these birds. 



N. Smythe, in addition to his work with the Environmental Sci- 

 ences Program, continues his studies of mammalian behavioral 

 ecology. 



H. Wolda continued his studies of fluctuation in abundance of 

 insect species. The moth Zunacetha annulata, which had a major 

 outbreak in 1971, had a somewhat smaller outbreak in 1973. Species 

 of the homopteran genus Empoasca had major peaks in abundance 

 in March-April in the last three years and were virtually absent in 

 the same period in 1974. The cicada Fidicina mannifera was much 

 less abundant in 1973 than in 1972, as evidenced by monitoring the 

 sound, number of pupal cases, and by light-trap data. Among the 

 important factors influencing these fluctuations are the strategies of 

 the species in dealing with unpredictable patterns of rainfall and 

 dry season. 



C. Birkeland is comparing the community structure and dynamics 

 of benthic marine populations on the coasts of Panama. 



D. Meyer continues his studies of crinoid populations in collabo- 

 ration with B. Macurda of the University of Michigan. 



P. Campanella has examined territorial behavior of four species 

 of dragonflies. Males of some species show a high degree of mating 

 site specificity, which appears to be related to population density and 

 availability of suitable ovipositing sites. Territory sizes are reduced 

 and spatial overlap is avoided by using the ponds at different times 

 of the day. 



M. May has continued studies on the effects of heat exchange, 

 heat production, and thermal tolerance in dragonflies of such factors 

 as body size, temporal and spatial distribution patterns, and various 

 energy-using activities. 



R. Warner began an investigation of the adaptive significance of 

 intersexuality commonly found in coral-reef fishes. He is correlating 

 population structure and behavior with the dynamics of sex change 

 in these fishes.

Censuses of Polistine wasps were carried out for a second year in 

 Costa Rica by D. Windsor. He has shown that in response to the 

 poorer foraging conditions and higher predator pressures of the dry 

 season there is an increase in the number of females per nesting 

 attempt. These and other observations indicate that sociahty has 

 evolved to aid reproduction during periods of poorer environmental 

 conditions. 



The carnivores of the New World tropics are poorly known, par- 

 ticularly when compared with those of Africa and Asia, where recent 

 studies on mongoose, lion, hyena, and tiger have been published. 

 R. F. Ewer has been at stri for the past year as a visiting senior 

 scholar. She has been studying the ethology of two neotropical cats 

 (ocelots and jaguarundis) and two mustelids (tayras and grisons). 

 Particular attention has been devoted to studying social and prey- 

 capturing behavior. 



D. Robertson, supported by a Commonwealth Science and Indus- 

 trial Research Organization (csiro) fellowship, is studying the 

 patterns of spawning activities in Thallasoma bifasciatum and its 

 relationships to hermaphroditism in this species. 



Y. Lubin completed her study of the nonadhesive orb-webs of 

 Cyrtophora moluccensis and is now collaborating with G. Mont- 

 gomery on a radio-tracking study of tamandua. 



In fiscal 1974 the Smithsonian Institution's Environmental Sci- 

 ences Program continued ecological monitoring at the three stri 

 sites in Panama. This interbureau effort in the tropics currently in- 

 volves the cooperation of about 10 principal investigators from 

 four bureaus. Spectral quality of solar radiation is being measured 

 at Flamenco Island. On Barro Colorado Island the emphasis is on 

 the tropical forests. We are beginning to understand the way in 

 which year-to-year fluctuations in climate, particularly in the 

 amount and distribution of rainfall, affect the plants and their re- 

 sponses, in turn, affect the animals. At Galeta, studies are proceed- 

 ing on the reef flat. Interest focuses on the causes of unpredictable 

 periods of reef exposure and the impact these have on the intertidal 

 community and its recovery patterns. 



STRI sponsored a workshop on the problems and strategies of 

 seedlings in tropical forests. Eight scientists from four countries par- 

 ticipated in a three-day meeting on Barro Colorado Island (bci). 



This year grants were obtained from the Henry L. and Grace 



138 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




Doherty and the Edward John Noble foundations for the purpose 

 of providing short-term fellowships to assist students in tropical re- 

 search. A number of students from United States and Panamanian 

 universities have already begun research supported by these funds. 



A number of our staff engaged in formal teaching this year. 

 O. Linares taught Anthropology at the University of Texas. J. Gra- 

 ham taught in the Fundamental Ecology course of the Organization 

 for Tropical Studies. P. Campanella gave a course in Ecology at the 

 Canal Zone College, and M. Robinson taught Invertebrate Behavior 

 at the University of Papua and New Guinea. 



Use of STRi facilities continues to increase, stri was host to 722 

 scientific visitors from 111 universities and other organizations. 

 These visitors represented 28 states and Puerto Rico as well as 21 

 countries from the Old and New Worlds. Twenty of these visitors 

 spent a full year at stri. The appointment of M. Quinley in February 

 as part-time docent has enabled us to initiate tours of stri by pri- 

 mary and secondary school and university groups. 



During 1974 major redevelopment of the bci waterfront area was 

 begun. The old boathouse was demolished, dredging has been com- 

 pleted, and the driving of new piles is scheduled. A new boathouse 

 and bulwark are planned. A small dormitory has been provided for 

 the Pacific Coast marine facilities. 



Renovation of the new Tivoli laboratory has been initiated. The 

 building has been reroofed, the exterior painted, and work has be- 

 gun to install the first seven laboratories.

Smithsonian Year '1974 



HISTORY AND ART 



In singling out a few particularly noteworthy events of the past 

 year one runs the risk of paying too little attention to the continu- 

 ing, quiet achievements that in the long run are perhaps more im- 

 portant. The temptation to stress dramatic change at the expense of 

 often undramatic continuity is familiar to every historian, and to 

 every writer of annual reports. 



Before succumbing to the temptation, then, we should at least 

 begin by saying that the past year was marked by steady growth 

 and consolidation within each of the Institution's history and art 

 bureaus, and by encouraging signs of continuing cooperation among 

 them. Without exception, collections were improved both by acqui- 

 sition and by conservation; control over collections was strength- 

 ened by better cataloguing and storage techniques; new exhibitions 

 were mounted with satisfying regularity; research and publication 

 continued in the best Smithsonian tradition; and programs of public 

 education made our collections and our research more accessible to 

 thousands of children and adults. 



The gradual growth of cooperation among our history and art 

 bureaus is another very welcome aspect of continuity rather than of 

 dramatic change. The joint appointment of a Curator of American 

 Art by the Freer Gallery of Art and the National Collection of Fine 

 Arts will strengthen both museums and will bring the Freer's im- 

 portant collection of American paintings into the mainstream of 

 scholarly activity. The Renwick Gallery of the National Collection 

 of Fine Arts, our museum-without-a-collection, continued to make 

 imaginative use of objects from the collections of the Museum of 

 Natural History and the Museum of History and Technology in illu- 

 minating exhibitions on the subject of design. The establishment in 

 the Museum of History and Technology of the Dwight D. Eisen- 



141 




hower Institute for Historical Research, and the appointment of Dr. 

 Forrest Pogue, the distinguished biographer of General George C. 

 Marshall, as its first director is the result of happy and fruitful col- 

 laboration between that museum and our National Armed Forces 

 Museum Advisory Board. With the cooperation of the National Por- 

 trait Gallery, the Archives of American Art will soon be able to open 

 an exhibition gallery in the Old Patent Office building, allowing the 

 public to see for the first time some of the treasures in its vast docu- 

 mentary collections. These developments, none of which is likely to 

 earn headlines, are evidence that the varied entities that compose the 

 Smithsonian Institution have the will and the means to work to- 

 gether toward a common purpose. 



We must now duly note, on the other hand, that the past year did 

 not lack its share — indeed, perhaps more than its share — of dra- 

 matic events. 



After what seemed to be years of delay and frustration, the Gen- 

 eral Services Administration declared that the Hirshhorn Museum 

 and Sculpture Garden was "substantially complete." The difference 

 between this somewhat mysterious technical determination and the 

 existence of a museum ready for the public is considerable; the first 

 three months of the next year will be a time of unceasing activity for 

 the museum's staff and the Institution's support facilities. 



The closing months of the past year also saw the accomplishment 

 of a major part of what must surely be the largest shipment of art in 

 the history of this country. With remarkable smoothness, at least 

 from the point of view of one observing with admiration from some 

 distance, the great Hirshhorn collections of sculpture and painting 

 were moved from various sites in New York City and Connecticut 

 to their home in and about the museum and sculpture garden on the 

 Mall. 



This was also the year in which the Museum of History and Tech- 

 nology gained a new director, and the Institution shared in the re- 

 flected glory of its first PuHtzer Prize. The prize winner was Daniel 

 Boorstin, for The Democratic Experience, the concluding volume of 

 his trilogy The Americans. Upon becoming a Senior Historian, Dr. 

 Boorstin was succeeded in the directorship of the Museum of History 

 and Technology by Dr. Brooke Hindle, a distinguished historian of 

 early American science and technology. An outstanding scholar who 

 has long been associated with museums, and whose university ex- 

 perience includes service as a departmental chairman and a dean. Dr.

Hindle brings to his new position the experience, the talents, and the 

 enthusiasm required for the directorship of the world's most visited 

 museum. 



The geographical scope of the Smithsonian was expanded during 

 the past year by the opening of the West Coast regional center of 

 the Archives of American Art. These centers, which now exist in 

 Detroit, New York, Boston, and San Francisco serve both as regional 

 research centers in which scholars may have access on microfilm to 

 the entire holdings of the Archives, and as the foci of the Archives 

 national collecting program. Often housed in contributed space — 

 we are indebted to the DeYoung Museum for the new center — and 

 staffed by only two or three people, these centers have an extraordi- 

 narily positive effect on the study of the history of American art 

 in their regions. 



After many years of activity behind the scenes, carried forward 

 with the generous support of the Congress, the Smithsonian's pro- 

 gram of activities for the Bicentennial of the American Revolution 

 produced its first public manifestation in 1974 : the exhibition at the 

 National Portrait Gallery entitled "In the Minds and Hearts of the 

 People — Prologue to the American Revolution: 1760-1774." En- 

 thusiastically reviewed by the press, and editorially commended by 

 The Washington Post, this exhibit is the first in a series of exhibits, 

 publications, and festivals with which the Institution will mark our 

 Nation's two-hundredth birthday. It is also pleasant to be able to 

 report here that the National Collection of Fine Arts, which had suf- 

 fered patiently the inconveniences of subway construction outside 

 its walls for several years, now enjoys once again the use of all its 

 galleries and of its front door. With the reinstallation of the Lincoln 

 Gallery, and the completion of galleries for miniatures and non- 

 American works, the ncfa is now able to show its collections and to 

 mount temporary exhibitions more appropriately and handsomely 

 than ever before. 



In short, then, the past year has been one of steady growth punc- 

 tuated by occasional, dramatic leaps forward. Between milestones — 

 such as the fiftieth anniversary of the Freer Gallery last year, the 

 opening of the Hirshhorn Museum next year, and the expected open- 

 ing of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum the year after — the real progress 

 takes place. 



Finally, we must sorrowfully record the death during the past year 



144 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




of Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post, one of the Institution's greatest 

 benefactors, and of Miss Elisabeth Houghton, a beloved and valued 

 member of the Board of Trustees of the Hirshhorn Museum. Each 

 will be remembered by the Smithsonian and by the public for her 

 contributions to our collections and museums. 



Archives of American Art 



With five regional offices in full operation for the first time, the 

 Archives experienced an unusually active year in both acquisitions 

 and use of its resources. Among the larger and more significant col- 

 lections of papers received were those of the New York sculptor 

 Paul Burlin, the painters Frank Duveneck, Barry Faulkner, and 

 Henry Varnam Poor, the painter and designer Gyorgy Kepes, and 

 the Detroit collector Hawkins Ferry. Records of three major art 

 galleries — Doll and Richards in Boston and the Rose Fried and 

 Maynard Walker Galleries in New York — were also accessioned. 

 The work of Walter Heil, Douglas MacAgy, and Alan Solomon, all 

 nationally prominent administrators and exhibition organizers, is 

 reflected in large groups of personal and professional papers. Insti- 

 tutional records made available for microfilming by the Archives 

 included those of the Cranbrook Academy and the Allen Memorial 

 Museum in Oberlin, Ohio. 



Three particularly interesting smaller groups of papers are a long 

 series of letters from Alfred Stieglitz to Arthur Dove, written in the 

 1920s and 1930s; 15 Maurice Prendergast letters to a friend and 

 collector, Mrs. Oliver Williams, and a diary kept by the New York 

 dealer WilUam Macbeth in the 1870s and 1880s. 



Thirteen hundred calls for documentation offered by the Archives 

 were made by visiting researchers at all regional offices, an increase 

 of one hundred over fiscal 1973 in spite of several weeks of interrup- 

 tion in service in the New York office. Over a thousand letters of 

 inquiry were answered and 520 rolls of microfilm were lent out 

 through interlibrary loan. The latter figure represents a 25-percent 

 increase over the previous year. 



The Archives' New York office underwent a major renovation in 

 the fall and held an opening reception, with a display of documents, 

 in its new quarters on the ground floor at 41 East 65th Street, in late 

 November 1973. Another display of documents was arranged in 



History and Art 1 145 




March 1974 in connection with a reception held to explain the 

 Archives to New York art dealers. An exhibition of letters from 

 Fitzwilliam Sargent containing passages on the growth and educa- 

 tion of his son John Singer Sargent was displayed at the Washington 

 office. 



The Archives Oral History Program continued its activities dur- 

 ing the year. Twenty-one interviews with artists were taped and 

 33 tapes were transcribed. A grant from the Andrew W. Mellon 

 Foundation, received in December, will enable the Archives to work 

 off a backlog of 165 untranscribed tapes. As an aid to researchers, 

 the Archives published a descriptive guide to 306 transcripts of 

 interviews conducted between 1958 and 1971, 



The Archives was the subject of three articles, one written by 

 Russell Lynes and published in American Heritage; one by David 

 Sokol published in Art in America, November-December 1973; and 

 a third by Garnett McCoy published in Manuscripts, Summer 1974. 

 In addition, 32 books, articles, and exhibition catalogues published 

 during the year acknowledged assistance from Archives resources. 

 Among these were James R. Mellow, Charmed Circle; June L. Ness, 

 Lyonel Feininger; Richard G. Coker, Portrait of an American Painter: 

 Edward Gay; Marguerite Zorach, The Early Years, 1908-1920 (Na- 

 tional Collection of Fine Arts); Robert Loftin Newman (National 

 Collection of Fine Arts); Vorticism and Its Allies (Arts Council of 

 Great Britain); and Jacob Lawrence (Whitney Museum of Ameri- 

 can Art).

of Decorative Arts and Design 



, Renovation activity has begun at the Carnegie Mansion and the first 

 phase should be completed by July of 1975. The collections and exhi- 

 bitions will be installed and the Museum will reopen to the public in 

 the winter of 1975-1976. 



During the past year the Museum organized a major exhibition of 

 over 300 drawings, textiles, and wallpapers entitled "The Art of 

 Decoration: Drawings and Objects from the Cooper-Hewitt Mu- 

 seum" at the Brooklyn Museum. A lecture series was given by the 

 staff in conjunction with this exhibition, A second exhibition, of 

 Winslow Homer drawings, was shown at the Columbia Museum of 

 Art and the Telfair Academy in Savannah. In addition, objects from 

 the collection were included in exhibitions at 23 institutions includ- 

 ing the Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Gallery of Art, Balti- 

 more Museum, Art Institute of Chicago, Pennsylvania Academy, 

 Princeton University, Harvard University, Amherst College, Rice 

 University, Finch College, and Pratt Institute. Exhibitions of nine- 

 teenth-century American drawings and new acquisitions in textiles 

 were shown briefly in the Carnegie Mansion. 



The collections were enriched by 671 items. The most outstanding 

 gifts were the "Martin Scrapbook" containing samples of eighteenth- 

 century French block-printed fabrics and Indian chintzes, a gouache 



History and Art 1 147 




drawing by Gino Severini, 8 nineteenth-century colored engravings 

 of political cartoons, a nineteenth-century American cast-iron man- 

 tel, 2 cast-iron baluster panels designed by George G. Elmslie, a 

 fashion drawing by Erte, 2 wallpapered folding screens, a collection 

 of turn-of-the-century embroideries and embroidered samplers from 

 the Eva Johnston Coe Collection. A total of 1562 objects were cata- 

 logued and 280 costumes were sent to the Smithsonian in Washing- 

 ton on long-term loan. 



The William H. Goodyear collection of architectural photographs 

 was transferred to the Cooper-Hewitt Library from the National 

 Museum of History and Technology. John Maximus gave another 

 portion (1919 items) of his classified pictorial reference library. The 

 Color and Light Archive was enlarged with a gift of 1293 items on 

 color by Mrs. L H. Godlove. 



A beginning was made toward the formulation of an Environmen- 

 tal Design collection dealing with the processes of design — how 

 design has been influenced by natural, technological, and cultural 

 forces, how it affects the human being physically and psychologi- 

 cally, and how it shapes landscapes and lifestyles. A meeting of 40 

 leading architects, designers, planners, and educators was held to 

 advise on the development of this collection. 



The Museum is presently conducting a study to determine the 

 kinds of information designers need, the format of such an informa- 

 tion system, and its use by professionals and the public. In order to 

 facilitate research and to save wear and tear on fragile objects, a 

 color slide catalogue of the collections was begun. This project has 

 been generously supported by the National Endowment for the Arts, 

 New York State Council, and the Mary Duke Biddle Trust. Slides 

 of over 6500 items have been made to date, as well as a slide kit 

 of embroideries. An anonymous gift was received to make a proto- 

 type film on traditional crafts in danger of disappearing. 



A series of lectures entitled, "The Fin de Siecle Medici: Carnegie 

 and the Designer" was held in the Carnegie Mansion. Billy Baldwin, 

 the famous New York interior designer, gave 4 lectures on "Decorat- 

 ing Today." Five lectures and a colloquium were given for the mem- 

 bership and 19 additional lectures were given by curators at other 

 museums. The children's workshops continued, and a tour was orga- 

 nized to see the furnishings and windows for Louis Comfort Tif- 

 fany's famous chapel in the workshop where they are being restored.

 36 inches; width of the arch is 35 inches, and length of the shelf is 71 inches. This 

 mantel was given to the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design by 

 Mrs. Whitney Atwood. 




Three members of the curatorial staff, Elaine Evans Dee, Milton 

 Sonday, and Catherine Lynn Frangiamore, received foundation 

 grants for research outside of the Museum. Mrs. Frangiamore's book 

 on wallpapers used in America will be published by Praeger next 

 spring. The staff was enlarged by two: Dorothy Twining Globus, 

 who joined the Museum's permanent exhibition staff, and Arete 

 Swartz, from the Victoria and Albert Museum, who worked in the 

 education department on a one-year grant. Twenty scholars studied 

 the collections, and 7 student interns received training. Special lec- 

 tures were given for visiting classes from New York University, City 

 University of New York, the Art Students League, Pratt Institute, 

 and Yale University. 



The Museum held an extremely successful benefit auction under 

 the chairmanship of Mrs. H. J. Heinz II. All of the items were do- 

 nated expressly for the sale by collectors, dealers, and other friends 

 of the Museum. A total of $125,000 was raised for the building fund. 

 Grants were received from the Charles Hayden Foundation, Janet 

 Neff Charitable Trust, Maya Corporation, Elsie de Wolfe Founda- 

 tion, and New York Community Trust, and an additional $72,000 

 was raised, largely from corporations and individual designers for a 

 Study Center in memory of Doris and Henry Dreyfuss. 



Freer Gallery of Art 



During fiscal year 1974 the Freer Gallery of Art celebrated its fiftieth 

 anniversary. To mark that occasion, the Gallery presented three 

 special exhibitions: "Japanese Ukiyoe Painting," "Chinese Figure 

 Painting," and "Ceramics from the World of Islam." The Gallery 

 published illustrated catalogues for each exhibition and organized 

 international symposia devoted to analysis of the three different 

 themes. Approximately 200 scholars and students participated in 

 each of the three programs. These anniversary activities and publi- 

 cations, which focused on the arts of the Far and Near East, sum- 

 marized a half century of acquisitions and research. 



On May 2, 1973, the Freer Medal was presented to the Japanese 

 specialist. Professor Tanaka Ichimatsu; on September 17, 1973, the 

 recipient was the noted museologist and historian of Chinese art.

 Medal for their "distinguished contribution to the knowledge and 

 understanding of Oriental civilizations as reflected in their arts." 



Construction of a specially designed X-ray room and installation 

 of initial X-ray equipment will enable the Freer Conservation Labora- 

 tory to keep pace with its steadily increasing activities. This essential 

 equipment will considerably facilitate the examination of objects in 

 the Collection and those being considered for study or purchase. In 

 addition, two X-ray diffraction cameras and tracks will be used to 

 identify pigments and corrosion products. 



In the course of fiscal 1974, the Collection has expanded by the 

 accession of 36 objects. Of those, several fine items were acquired 

 by gift from the estates of Mrs. Agnes E. Meyer and Mr. Myron 

 Bement Smith. Other objects of importance were presented by Mrs. 

 Anna Chennault and Mr. Yoichi Nakajima. 



Harold P. Stern, Director, participated in the seventh meeting of 

 the United States-Japan Conference on Cultural and Educational 

 Interchange in Tokyo on June 17-20. Thomas Lawton, Assistant 

 Director, and W. Thomas Chase III, Head Conservator, were among 

 the 12 members of the American Art and Archaeology Delegation 

 who visited the People's Republic of China from November 10 

 through December 9, 1973. 



Special exhibitions at the Freer Gallery were "Turkish Art of the 

 Ottoman Period" (August 1, 1973, through December 19, 1973), 

 "Chinese Figure Painting" (September 11, 1973, through November 

 30, 1973), and "Ceramics from the World of Islam" (January 17, 

 1974, through June 30, 1974). 



Rutherford J. Gettens joined the staff of the Freer Gallery of Art 

 on October 1, 1951.During the more than 20 years of his association 

 with the Gallery, he was instrumental in establishing the Technical 

 Laboratory and in maintaining its high level of research. His publi- 

 cations on problems relating to pigment analysis and on the fabrica- 

 tion of Chinese bronze vessels achieved an international reputation 

 for him and the Laboratory. After his retirement in 1968, Mr. Get- 

 tens remained active in the position of Research Consultant. His 

 unexpected death on June 17, 1974, at the age of 74, is an irreplace- 

 able loss.

Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden 



The public opening of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden 

 is scheduled for October 1, 1974. 



Final plans were developed for the inaugural exhibition, utilizing 

 scale models, photographic aids, and full-scale mock-ups in styro- 

 foam of monumental pieces of sculpture, to help determine place- 

 ment of works in the outdoor sculpture garden and plaza. 



Production was completed on postcards, reproductions, and color 

 slides illustrating outstanding works from the Collection which will 

 be available to the public in the Museum shop. 



It was a year marked by the transfer of the Hirshhorn Museum 

 and Sculpture Garden (hmsg) offices and personnel from New York 

 to temporary quarters in the Arts and Industries Building in July 

 1973; and then to the new building on December 27, 1973. Beneficial 

 occupancy of the new Museum was accepted by the Smithsonian on 

 March 29, 1974. 



On April 17, 1974, title to the extensive collections included in 

 the Agreement of May 17, 1966, passed from Mr. Joseph H. Hirsh- 

 horn to the Smithsonian Institution. This action was immediately 

 followed by implementation of previously established plans for 

 moving the Collection. 



The substantial task of moving the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculp- 

 ture Garden collections to Washington, D.C., from various points 

 including New York City, Greenwich, Connecticut, and Toronto, 

 Canada, was commenced on April 14, 1974. The move was accom- 

 plished on schedule, with pieces in the opening exhibition being in 

 the vanguard in order to permit the Exhibits and Design staff to 

 begin the installation. A 



In 1974 the inaugural book/catalogue went to press. This 750- 

 page volume includes 1001 paintings and sculptures which are docu- 

 mented and reproduced — 296 in color. The foreword is by S. Dillon 

 Ripley, Secretary of the Smithsonian, with an introduction by 

 Abram Lerner, Director of the Hirshhorn Museum, and essays by 

 six outstanding art scholars. These complement the selected com- 

 mentaries and historical data, and make up a scholarly and stimulat- 

 ing volume. A souvenir booklet. An Introduction to the Hirshhorn 

 Museum and Sculpture Garden, is also in production. 



Looking beyond the Museum's opening, research was begun on

the program of future exhibitions. A series of research exhibitions 

 were planned, as well as a program for research fellows. In fiscal year 

 1974, too, documentation and cataloguing of the permanent collec- 

 tion progressed. 



During this period the staff paused to mourn the passing of two 

 dedicated individuals who contributed greatly to the planning and 

 development of the Museum's programs: On March 2, 1974, the 

 staff was saddened to hear of the death of Miss Elisabeth Houghton, 

 a member of the Museum's Board of Trustees and a lifelong cham- 

 pion of civic causes. She was one of the original members of the 

 Board, having been appointed by President Nixon in 1971. On Sep- 

 tember 6, 1973, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden lost 

 the invaluable collaboration of Mr. Douglas MacAgy, who super- 

 vised the preliminary design of our inaugural exhibition. Mr. Mac- 

 Agy 's contribution was outstanding and his previous experience 

 with the National Endowment for the Arts was of great help in our 

 initial planning. 



The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden has been most suc- 

 cessful in recruiting qualified and outstanding personnel in the pro- 

 fessional field to fill new positions, and to replace those who have 

 left our ranks: The Board of Trustees, at their April 4, 1974, meeting, 

 voted to appoint Miss Anne d'Harnoncourt to the Board for a term 

 expiring in 1980. At this meeting the Honorable Daniel P. Moynihan 

 was reelected Chairman, and Dr. George Heard Hamilton was re- 

 elected Vice Chairman. 



The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden staff was aug- 

 mented by the following appointments: Stephen E. Weil, Deputy 

 Director; Charles W. Millard, Chief Curator; Charles Froom, In- 

 stallation Designer; Edward Lawson, Chief, Education Program; 

 Mary Ann Tighe, Education Specialist; and Douglas Robinson, 

 Registrar. 



"Inside the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden," a special 

 series of lectures on the Museum and its collections began on January 

 21, 1974, with a talk by the Director on "Joseph H. Hirshhorn, Col- 

 lector." This series, begun at the request of the Resident Associates 

 program, had an enrollment of thirty-eight subscribers. Its nine lec- 

 tures included a talk on the installation of the Inaugural Exhibition 

 by Charles Froom, Installation Designer, and Cynthia McCabe dis- 

 cussing the content of the opening exhibition. Other talks included

160 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




The Museum continued to respond to requests and inquiries from 

 scholars and researchers and maintained its policy of lending out- 

 standing works of art to national and international exhibitions. More 

 than 235 requests for research information were answered by the 

 Department of Painting and Sculpture. Fifty paintings and sculp- 

 tures were loaned to 25 museums, galleries, and institutions. 



The Alberto Giacometti Retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggen- 

 heim Museum, New York, from April 5 to June 23, 1974, included 

 the sculpture "Seated Women" from the Hirshhorn Museum Col- 

 lections. Other artists whose works have been borrowed for exhibi- 

 tions in Spring 1974 are: Karl Knaths (International Exhibitions 

 Foundation, Washington, D.C., tour); Zoltan Kemeny (Foundation 

 Maeght, Paris); Horace Pippin (Delaware Art Museum, Wilming- 

 ton); Jacob Lawrence (Whitney Museum of American Art, New 

 York, and tour) ; and Mark Tobey (National Collection of Fine Arts, 

 Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. 



Among recent volumes which reproduced paintings and sculpture 

 from the Collections are: American Masters: The Voice and the 

 Myth by Brian O'Doherty (New York, Random House), Elie Nadel- 

 man by Lincoln Kirstein (New York, Eakins Press), Grandma Moses 

 by Otto Kallir (New York, Harry N. Abrams), and Henry Moore in 

 America by Henry J. Seldis (New York, Praeger). 



Formal training sessions for 75 volunteer docents were begun by 

 the HMSG Education Department on January 15, 1974, to continue 

 thru May 28, to be followed by an intensive training period in the 

 Museum galleries. The training course is made up of slide lectures 

 and demonstratioins, and will involve extensive work in the galleries 

 with the paintings and sculpture.

Joseph Henry Papers 



The research and editing for the second volume of The Papers of 

 Joseph Henry are now very close to completion. The volume, docu- 

 menting Henry's career from the end of 1832 through 1835, will 

 introduce Henry to his new environment at Princeton, follow his 

 activities as Professor of Natural Philosophy at the College of New 

 Jersey, and detail the resumption of his electrical research, mainly 

 on self-induction. One of the highlights of the volume will be an 

 extensive run of documents from the first of three laboratory note- 

 books kept by Henry at Princeton and the Smithsonian, and now 

 preserved in the Smithsonian Archives. The notebooks reflect the 

 pace and style of Henry's daily research as well as the evolution of 

 his scientific ideas over several decades. The documents in the second 

 volume also portray the dramatic expansion of Henry's scientific 

 role and associations during his early Princeton years, while shed- 

 ding new light on scientific centers like Philadelphia. 



While the regular collecting and research activities of the project 

 go on, preparations are now being made for seeing the second vol- 

 ume through the Smithsonian Press and for the editing of volume 

 three of our series, documenting, among other events in Henry's 

 life, his 1837 trip to Europe. His diary from that journey, marking 

 Henry's formal introduction to the international science scene, pro- 

 vides an extraordinary record of transatlantic communication in sci- 

 ence. Plans are also underway for the editing of a special volume of 

 lectures and essays by Joseph Henry, based upon manuscripts from 

 throughout his career. It is hoped that this special volume, treating 

 topics such as Henry's philosophy of science, will appeal to a wide 

 audience, both scholarly and popular, and will perhaps be found 

 suitable for classroom use at the college and graduate levels. 



Significant progress was also made in organizing and cataloguing 

 the Joseph Henry Library, Henry's personal reference collection. A 

 wide-ranging collection with numerous rare volumes, the Library is 

 an invaluable resource for appreciating Henry's scientific develop- 

 ment and scientific literature of the day. Plans are now going for- 

 ward to publish an annotated catalogue of the collection for the 

 general use of historians. 



The project continues to sponsor and participate in various Smith- 



162 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




sonian educational activities. Visiting scholars continued to exploit 

 the Henry Papers' collections and resources. Nathan Reingold's 

 seminar on the nineteenth century had another successful year. 



National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board 



With the approval of the National Armed Forces Museum Advisory 

 Board, the Smithsonian Institution entered into a cooperative agree- 

 ment with the Department of the Interior. The agreement provides 

 a basis upon which the Smithsonian may fulfill its responsibilities 

 under the Act of August 30, 1961 (75 Stat. 414, 20 USC 80-80d). 

 Under the agreement the two agencies may work jointly in advanc- 

 ing outdoor museum programs, short term and long term, to illumi- 

 nate historical American attitudes toward matters of national defense 

 and past contributions by the Armed Forces to American society 

 and culture. 



Representatives of the National Park Service and the staff of the 

 National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board pursued planning 

 for a special Bicentennial program to dramatize the spirit of the 

 American people in the struggle for independence. The program is 

 to be presented to the public at Washington, D. C, during the 

 summer of 1976. It will portray the life of the citizen-soldier of the 

 American Revolution through the medium of living history. The 

 program will take place out of doors. 



The National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board at the close 

 of fiscal year 1974 consisted of the following members.

 can be included with the pursuit and refinement of knowledge as 

 part of artistic education. Although some 1556 paintings, sculptures, 

 and graphic works were added to the Collection this year (the Col- 

 lection now numbers about 17,000), and study continues to refine 

 the computerized listings and to improve accessibility, collecting is 

 only one aspect of a complex program. Since the museum believes 

 that the circumstances under which a work of art is encountered 

 has much to do with an awareness of its qualities, great effort has 

 been made to present each of the over 900 works from the collection 

 now on display to its best advantage for the modern viewer. This 

 has required, in addition to a continuing conservation and reframing 

 program, the careful design of each area to create not a synthetic 

 historical past but a convincing artistic present. This year the totally 

 reorganized Lincoln Gallery was reopened, the Doris M. Magowan 

 Gallery of Portrait Miniatures was completed, and a new gallery 

 was established for some of the museum's other-than-American 

 works, including a fine Rubens and a recently identified Guercino. 

 Including the Renwick Gallery, about 78,000 square feet of gallery 

 space is now open to the public. Part of that space is reserved for 

 temporary exhibitions which carry out the ncfa's concern for the 

 reexamination of little-known aspects of American art as well as 

 occasional tribute to acknowledged masters. Of the 21 exhibitions 

 planned and produced by the staff this year (in all, 25 were pre- 

 sented) some were studies of individual artists ranging from the less 

 well known including Margarite Zorach and Herman Webster to the 

 distinguished ceramists Gertrude and Otto Natzler and the eminent 

 painter Mark Tobey. Especially popular was an exhibition of draw- 

 ings on Smithsonian letterhead made by Saul Steinberg while in 

 residence at the Smithsonian in 1967. Investigating special themes 

 were such exhibitions as "A Measure of Beauty," "Shaker," and 

 "Art of the Pacific Northwest from the 1930s to the Present." As 

 one in a series calling attention to artistic quality in works from other 

 Smithsonian Collections, "Boxes and Bowls" was mounted at the 

 Renwick Gallery, affording 'a new look at historical works from 

 several Northwest Coast Indian groups. Publications, either major

 originals which are now at the Norfolk Botanical Gardens.

monographs or smaller catalogues, were issued in association with 

 almost all exhibitions. 



Exhibitions from abroad shown at the Renwick Gallery included 

 paintings from Pakistan and a retrospective of two hundred years 

 of Royal Copenhagen porcelain. Ten exhibitions provided by the 

 National Collection were in circulation to other countries during the 

 year, among them "Made in Chicago" (works by Chicago artists) 

 which traveled through South America and "Fabric Vibrations," an 

 exhibition originating at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, 

 which circulated in Southeast Asia, carrying the modern craft of tie 

 dye to its ancient home. 



The many established activities for making the museum accessible 

 to a wide public continued with an expanded Department of Educa- 

 tion. Young visitors expressed pleasure with the new children's 

 gallery, "Explore." Students continued with the Discover Graphics 

 program and a group of high-school-age "junior interns" enlivened 

 many activities of the museum. Education of a different kind was 

 carried on by six doctoral fellows and two senior fellows engaged 

 in research on American art. To such scholars, ncfa's rapidly ex- 

 panding Bicentennial Inventory of American Painting before 1914 

 will be of great help when ready for use in 1976. The National Col- 

 lection of Fine Arts joined with the University of Delaware in the 

 spring to organize a symposium on late nineteenth-century Amer- 

 ican art. Throughout the museum during the year were university 

 students learning the various processes of museum operation as 

 interns, helping to keep the entire staff aware that learning and 

 teaching go hand in hand.

National Museum of History and Technology 



On January 23, 1974, the National Museun\ of History and Tech- 

 nology entered its second decade. Marking its tenth anniversary. 

 Chief Justice and Smithsonian Chancellor Warren Burger with 

 Secretary Ripley named the Museum's auditorium in memory of 

 Leonard Carmichael, the Secretary whose vision and determination 

 had brought about the planning, approval, and construction of this 

 Museum. At the Museum's dedication 10 years earlier. President 

 Lyndon Johnson had expressed his belief that "this Museum will do 

 that which causes us all to celebrate; it will excite a thirst for knowl- 

 edge among all people." Since its founding, the National Museum 

 of History and Technology has welcomed nearly 55 million visitors. 

 Yearly attendance has grown steadily, now reaching 7 million per 

 year. Last April, visitor attendance topped the million mark, making 

 the highest monthly attendance ever registered in a Smithsonian 

 building. Attendance is expected to be vastly increased during our 

 second decade as the Nation carries out its Bicentennial celebrations. 



On the first of October 1973, Dr. Daniel J. Boorstin moved from 

 the directorship of the Museum to the post of Senior Historian in 

 the National Museum of History and Technology, a position which 

 allows him to devote more of his energies to research and writing. 

 In May 1974, Dr. Boorstin received the Pulitzer Prize for History 

 for The Americans: The Democratic Experience, the final volume in 

 his trilogy on the American people. The writing of this volume had 

 been completed during the four years of his directorship. 



Dr. Boorstin's successor. Professor Brooke Hindle, was appointed 

 after nomination by museum curators and began his tenure in Feb- 

 ruary. A faculty member of the New York University since 1950, 

 his two most recent posts have been as Dean of the University 

 College of Arts and Science and Head of the University Department 

 of History. Known for his distinctive works. The Pursuit of Science 

 in Revolutionary America 1735-1785; David Rittenhouse: A Biog- 

 raphy; and Technology in America: Needs and Opportunities, Dr. 

 Hindle is presently editing a volume which summarizes the confer- 

 ence he planned for Sleepy Hollow Restorations on "America's 

 Wooden Age." His present research assesses the role of industrial 

 fairs in advancing the technology of their time. His particular focus 

 has been the Centennial Exposition of 1876 — from which the

Oiling and cleaning of the machinery in the Power and Tool Halls is an important 

 phase of the daily routine before volunteers operate equipment for their lectures and 

 demonstrations. Marjorie Miller, a National Museum of History and Technology 

 Docent volunteer is one of several skilled in this challenging task, which always 

 brings an interested audience. 




Smithsonian Institution drew its first significant holdings of 

 machinery and technological artifacts, now housed in this Museum. 



Several series of public lectures were continued from last year 

 with considerable success as an important form of contact with thes 

 visiting public and outreach to the Washington community. The 

 National Museum of History and Technology in its second series of 

 Frank Nelson Doubleday Lectures considered "Creativity and Col- 

 laboration," looking at the special opportunities and pressures of 

 our age to collaborate, and asking how particular collaborations — 

 in industry, scientific research, the media, city planning, and govern- 

 ment — had affected creativity and brought about growth and 

 change. Speakers were Japanese industrialist Akio Morita, President 

 and co-founder of Sony Corporation; Nobel Prize- winning biologist 

 James Dewey Watson, whose collaboration with Francis Crick 

 resulting in an understanding of DNA was heralded as one of the 

 most dramatic research breakthroughs of modern times; British 

 Broadcasting Corporation's Managing Director of Television Huw 

 Wheldon; Israeli-born Canadian architect Moshe Safdie, designer 

 of Habitat; and Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Caspar 

 W. Weinberger. Each lecturer also took part in a luncheon seminar, 

 allowing for an open exchange of ideas among curators, the lecturer, 

 and special guests. Doubleday and Company has renewed its grant 

 for a third year of lectures in "The Frontiers of Knowledge" series. 



The Museum also continued a series of lectures with the U.S. 

 Postal Service relating to new postage stamp issues. Extremely 

 popular lectures included "The Continental Congresses" and "Rise 

 of the Spirit of Independence." First Day ceremonies were held for 

 the block of eight 10-cent stamps commemorating the Universal 

 Postal Union Centennial. 



In addition to these evening lectures, the Museum has provided, 

 since last January, weekly daytime Museum Talks by curators and 

 qualified museum aides, technicians, and specialists. When moved 

 from Saturdays to Tuesdays at lunchtime, these slide talks have 

 drawn large audiences both of Museum visitors, neighboring gov- 

 ernment employees, and Museum staff. The lectures reflect both the 

 Museum's varied collections and current staff research projects. 

 Some of the most exciting presentations have included demonstra- 

 tions of historic objects front our collections, from the early sound- 

 amplifying devices of inventor Elisha Gray, a contemporary of 



172 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




Alexander Graham Bell, to the operation of the common printing 

 prefs. 



The primary efforts of all staff during the past year have been 

 spent in readying the National Museum of History and Technology's 

 five major exhibitions for the Bicentennial period. The first, opening 

 this coming September 20th on the lower level, is an exhibition on 

 the two-hundred-year history of American clothing. "Suiting Every- 

 one," the story of America's transition from homespun or tailor- 

 made garments to ready-to-wear, is an interdisciplinary exhibit, 

 bringing together the Division of Costume and Furnishings, whose 

 costume collection was greatly enriched by a massive clothing appeal 

 this year; the Division of Textiles, which offers the machines and 

 textiles of manufacture; and the Division of Military History, which 

 has supplied examples of early mass-produced clothing — soldiers' 

 imiforms. A major new installment of the National Museum of 

 History and Technology's political history wing is scheduled for 

 opening the middle of next year. The theme of "A Nation of Na- 

 tions," pluralism in American life, is particularly suited to this 

 Museum, which has become the repository for many thousands of 

 artifacts which were family heirlooms, treasured possessions, and 

 creations of American people of every ethnic, racial, and religious 

 origin. 



Considerable staff attention was directed to restoration work on 

 the exhibition "1876 — A Centennial," an exciting project which 

 will transform a portion of the Arts and Industries Building into a 

 microcosm of the Philadelphia Exposition of 1876 capturing the 

 festive and optimistic spirit of America on its one-hundredth birth- 

 day. This exhibit will manifest the exuberance of a Victorian extrav- 

 aganza, an atmosphere of organized chaos, with all spaces dominated 

 by an enormous variety of material objects. Finally, Vladimir and 

 Elvira Clain-Stefanelli, Curators of the Division of Numismatics, are 

 preparing a special exhibition on the history of American banks and 

 banking, supported by the American Bankers Association, to open 

 in September of 1975. 



This year the Dwight D. Eisenhower Institute for Historical 

 Research, a study and conference center which will make important 

 contributions to national study and evaluation of the Armed Forces, 

 their importance in war and in maintaining peace, was brought to 

 full realization with the appointment of Dr. Forrest C. Pogue, Direc- 



History and Art 1 173 




tor of the George C. Marshall Research Library in Lexington, 

 Virginia, and widely known biographer of George Marshall, to the 

 directorship of the new Institute. 



As part of the Institution's overall decentralization program, the 

 National Museum of History and Technology assumed the admin- 

 istration of its own Office of Exhibits and Building Management 

 Division. From the Smithsonian's decentralization of the Office of 

 Primary and Secondary Education has come a new approach to the 

 Museum's education responsibilities, which have been formalized 

 in a new Division of Public Information and Education. In addition 

 to conducting tours and developing visitor programs, the Office will 

 establish a visitor center on the Museum's first floor to orient the 

 visitor and answer pubHc inquiries. This past year a staff associate 

 was hired to adapt museum exhibits and activities to the needs of 

 the handicapped. The staff associate, being herself handicapped, 

 concentrated her efforts on developing tours for the blind and deaf 

 with great success. Experiments were conducted with Braille labels 

 and subtitled films, and the results will be incorporated into future 

 exhibit planning. Alice Reno joined the staff in late spring as Super- 

 visor of the Division. 



And on a playful note, the National Museum of History and 

 Technology displayed in each public restroom an exhibit panel 

 tracing with graphics the history of "Bathrooms in America." It 

 leaves visitors contemplating the chamber pot and closestool of 

 earlier days, with a sense of the full impact of technology on the 

 American way of life. 



Locating and collecting objects and memorabilia for Bicentennial 

 exhibitions was by far the dominating activity of the Museum's staff 

 this past year as progress continues simultaneously on four major 

 subject exhibitions. 



The Division of Costume and Furnishings initiated an unusual 

 collecting effort for the exhibit, "Suiting Everyone," utilizing a news 

 release and list of items needed for display. The response was over- 

 whelming, resulting in the acquisition of a large number of items of 

 clothing from 1920 to 1970 that ranged from representative clothing 

 worn by the majority of Americans to examples produced by the 

 industry's greatest designers. 



The preparation of the exhi-bition has benefited enormously from 

 the valuable assistance provided by a panel of advisors from the 



174 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




Rearrangement of the reference collections of the Division of Textiles has resulted 

 in more adequate storage of the Division's extensive collections of quilts, sam- 

 plers, and rugs, making them more accessible to the staff and visiting students 

 and scholars.

fashion community. Given the incredible breadth of the Smithsonian 

 collections and the interdisciplinary perspective gained from the 

 participating Museum staff, the exhibit promises to have a profound 

 impact on the future study of American clothing and its industry. 



The full staff of the Division of Political History devoted its 

 major effort to the forthcoming exhibition hall to be entitled "We, 

 the People." They have been engrossed in the challenging task of 

 selecting and acquiring objects illustrating the role of American 

 government in the lives of the American people. Objects have been 

 collected from resources within the Museum as well as from other 

 Smithsonian and Federal agencies. Conservation of the First Ladies' 

 Gowns also continued, bringing the total number of First Lady 

 patterns now completed to twenty. In cooperation with the Division 

 of Textiles, the skirt of the dress of Martha Washington was 

 restored as the first project in a long-term program for the conserva- 

 tion and restoration of the First Ladies' Gowns. As part of this 

 program, Barbara Coffee, Museum Specialist in this Division, re- 

 ceived a grant from the Secretary's fund to explore costume preser- 

 vation and restoration being done in museums in England, The 

 Netherlands, and in Sweden. 



The new Henry R. Luce Hall of News Reporting continued to 

 draw enthusiastic crowds, and plans are now underway by the 

 Smithsonian to produce a film and a traveling exhibit based on the 

 Hall. Two exhibitions have been shown in the Hall's Print Gallery: 

 "Prang's American Chromos," showing the step-by-step production 

 of a twenty-six color lithograph; and "Anatomy of a Gallop," a 

 comparison between the lithographs by Currier and Ives of racing 

 horses and the contemporary photographs by Muybridge of the 

 same subject. 



The Division of Medical Sciences devoted considerable effort to 

 the preparation of the exhibit "Triumph Over Disability" in the 

 Hall of Health. The exhibit was made possible by a grant from the 

 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine. Each Friday, films 

 and lectures on the subject are offered in the Leonard Carmichael 

 Auditorium, 



Several major exhibits were closed and dismantled this past year 

 in preparation for Bicentennial activities. This necessitated the re- 

 moval and temporary storage of thousands of valuable objects, a 

 project that required the involvement of more than half the Mu-

scum's divisions and staff. The "Growth of the United States/' "Art 

 and Spirit of a People," "American Costume/' and "Historic Ameri- 

 cans" were among the halls closed, as well as the special exhibits 

 "Music Machines" and "A Children's World/' 



Several large objects were removed to other more visible areas, 

 including the relocation of the John Bull locomotive. Granite blocks, 

 especially cut for the purpose, support pieces of the original rail 

 used in 1831 under the engine. 



The main focus of attention for "1876: A Centennial Exhibit" is 

 upon the restoration of objects and cases of the period that will be 

 utilized within the displays. The restoration and refurbishing of 

 those objects that were displayed nearly one hundred years ago, for 

 which a unique restoration task force has been organized within the 

 Museum, are proceeding on a scale unprecedented in the history of 

 the Institution. 



Since that facet of the Centennial which had the largest public 

 impact was the overwhelming array of machinery and power equip- 

 ment, the Division of Mechanical and Civil Engineering has a pri- 

 mary involvement in it. Robert M. Vogel, Curator of Heavy Ma- 

 chinery and Civil Engineering, is co-curator in charge, and Edwin A. 

 Battison, Curator of Light Machinery, has responsibility for the 

 machine-tool exhibits. 



The practicality of the exhibition was founded primarily upon the 

 vast collection of Centennial memorabilia carefully preserved and 

 housed in many parts of the Institution. The machinery and models 

 will form the nucleus of the exhibition, supplemented by other fine 

 examples of the types exhibited at the Philadelphia Exposition. 



For many months, members of the staff have traveled to record 

 centers, archives, and libraries, conducting research, recording and 

 photographing available documentary evidence in support of the 

 present restoration. Factories and industrial firms on the verge of 

 demolition have been contacted in an effort to locate furnishings and 

 fittings so very vital to achieving the atmosphere of 1876. 



Restoration of this equipment is being performed in three separate 

 shops created for this purpose under the general supervision of 

 William K. Henson, Supervisor of the Science and Technology De- 

 partment's Technical Laboratory. 



The main facility, headed by Museum Specialist Charles E. Den- 

 nison, is responsible for the restoration of machinery such as ma-

Objects exhibited at the International Exhibition of 1876 held in Philadelphia are 

 being restored to original appearance and condition in the Technical Laboratories 

 of the National Museum of History and Technology, as part of the preparation for 

 the Bicentennial exhibit.

chine tools, fittings, and steam engines of sizes that can be accommo- 

 dated in the basement shops of the Museum. Here, objects are first 

 disassembled, marked, chemically cleaned, and restored to original 

 condition with close adherence to all available published references 

 and illustrations. All broken parts are repaired, and missing parts 

 are duplicated to permit each object to not only look but perform 

 as new. 



Machines and tools too large and cumbersome for the in-house 

 shop are restored at a newly created second facility at Silver Hill 

 under the supervision of Museum Technician William T. Tearman. 



A shop on the fifth floor of the National Museum of History and 

 Technology serves as the third restoration facility for relatively 

 small objects, at present principally a selection of the hundreds of 

 patent models exhibited at the Philadelphia Fair, and the cutting and 

 sewing of small intricate sails for many of the ship models. 



One of the most interesting phases of the work that has spread 

 excitement throughout the entire staff has been that concerned with 

 the stripping of layers of decorative paint and the detective work 

 necessary to repaint and decorate the finished items. An example is 

 the Linde-Wolk steam engine recently acquired by the Institution 

 from the American Brewery in Baltimore, Maryland. When the Tech- 

 nical Laboratory personnel commenced their routine documentation 

 of the colors and designs applied to the engine over the years — 

 stripping away each successive coat of paint, taking record photo- 

 graphs, and tracing the decorative patterns — they discovered among 

 its dozen discrete layers of paint an intricate panorama of delicately 

 shaded flowers and exquisite filigrees. While the notion of such 

 painstaking art work on a huge industrial engine may now seem 

 anomalous, in an earlier era it clearly was considered a proper ad- 

 junct. When completed, the engine will be repainted and decorated 

 as it was many years ago. 



To assist with the unprecedented workload imposed by the res- 

 toration program for "1876," six additions were made to the crew; 

 each new man boasts some specialized aptitude or skill essential to 

 the successful consummation of the program. Among other individ- 

 ual projects are the refurbishment of a 42-foot span from a Howe 

 truss bridge and a group of components salvaged from the Girard 

 Avenue Bridge in Philadelphia — a bridge built at the time of the 

 Centennial and dismantled a few years ago. 



180 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




Research and work on furnishings and other phases of the exhibi- 

 tion are proceeding under the direction of Cultural History Curator 

 Rodris Roth and Museum Technician Susan Myers. William Miner 

 of the Office of Exhibits is overall coordinator of the project. 



Highlighting the activities of the Division of Musical Instruments 

 was a program produced for the Renwick Gallery entitled "Ameri- 

 can Music and Ballroom Dance, 1840-1860," utilizing wind instru- 

 ments and a Chickering piano of the period. Cynthia Hoover, James 

 Weaver, and Robert Sheldon edited the music. Restoration projects 

 completed included the production of measured drawings for the 

 1760 Stehlin harpsichord, preparation of wind instruments for the 

 "American Music" performance, and work on a 1794 Broadwood 

 grand piano. Thomas Wolf, keyboard instrument maker, joined the 

 staff as the first participant in a two-year program for training of con- 

 servators of musical instruments, a service offered for the first time 

 by the Institution and the only program of its kind in the country. 



The Division of Numismatics was joint host, with the American 

 Numismatic Society, of the 1973 International Numismatic Con- 

 gress which met for the first time in the United States in September 

 1973, Opening in New York City, the Congress moved to Washing- 

 ton, where numerous papers were presented in the Museum to an 

 attendance of 329 numismatists and guests representing 32 coun- 

 tries. A special exhibition of medals commemorating the battles of 

 the American Revolution was produced by the Division with an 

 interpretative publication. A derivative of the Congress was a three- 

 volume Survey of Numismatic Research, of which Mrs. Elvira Clain- 

 Stefanelli was the editor of the section on medals. 



In November, the Division of Naval History co-sponsored the 

 American Meeting of the Society for the History of Discoveries in 

 concert with the Library of Congress and the U.S. National Archives. 

 Featured were sessions on the exploration of the Americas and on 

 cartographic resources from the era of the American Revolution. 



On May 30, the Secretary presented to Dr. Vladimir Clain- 

 Stefanelli and to Mrs. Elvira Clain-Stefanelli the Exceptional Service 

 Gold Medal Award "in recognition of the successful acquisition and 

 display of the Josiah K. Lilly Collection of gold coins and their many 

 other achievements and accomplishments in the numismatic world 

 and for their tireless devotion to the development of one of the 



History and Art I 181 




world's finest numismatic collections." In September, Dr. and Mrs. 

 Clain-Stefanelli were awarded the 1973 Leonard Forrer Medal by 

 the International Association of Professional Numismatists "for 

 their work for the increase and diffusion of knowledge in the field 

 of numismatics." 



Peter C. Marzio, Associate Curator of the Division of Graphic 

 Arts, received a Fulbright Research Grant which enabled him to 

 study nineteenth-century American artists in Rome during most of 

 the past year. Bernard S. Finn, Curator of Electricity, spent a sab- 

 batical leave in London where he helped prepare a special exhibition 

 and booklet on submarine telegraphy at The Science Museum, en- 

 titled "Leave It to the Mermaids," in which technical developments 

 were placed in their social context. The exhibit included objects from 

 a number of museums, the Smithsonian Institution, corporations 

 and individuals in the United States as well as in Great Britain. Jon 

 B. Eklund, Curator of Chemistry, was on a year's leave of absence, 

 during which he was Visiting Professor of Chemistry at the New 

 York Historical Association at Cooperstown. 



Another recipient of an award was Harold D. Langley, Curator of 

 Naval History, who received a research grant for work in the col- 

 lections of the American Antiquarian Society on early American 

 flags and newspaper sources for American reaction to the Peace of 

 Ghent in 1815. Robert M. Vogel, Curator of Mechanical and Civil 

 Engineering, conducted a week-long seminar at Cooperstown deal- 

 ing with the techniques of field recording, photography, map inter- 

 pretation, and site analysis relating to historic and industrial arche- 

 ology. He also assisted in organizing a symposium celebrating the 

 250th Anniversary of the Carpenters' Company of Philadelphia, 

 "Building Early America," presenting a paper on materials handling 

 and steam excavation. Senior Scientific Scholar Robert P. Multhauf 

 also participated in the conference as well as in a colloquium at the 

 Burndy Library in Connecticut on the relationship between science 

 and technology. 



In December 1973, William Seale joined the staff as Curator in 

 the Division of Ethnic and Western Cultural History. His fields of 

 activity include the history of American architecture and the mate- 

 rial culture of the south-central and southeastern United States dur- 

 ing the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. He was co-author of a 

 survey of the state capitol buildings of the United States. During the 

 year, three new chairmen were appointed to the Museum's depart-

 1974, he visited Jordan and participated in a conference at the Uni- 

 versity of Jordan. Later, he visited Cairo, where he completed re- 

 search on his book. The Physician, Therapist and Surgeon Ihn al- 

 Quff, which has since been published in Cairo. 



Cooperation with organizations concerned with preservation and 

 history continued this year, with the Division of Mechanical and 

 Civil Engineering as corporate and editorial headquarters of the 

 Society for Industrial Archeology. Curator Robert M. Vogel serves 

 as editor of the Newsletter, the only international publication in the 

 field. John H. White, Jr., Curator of Transportation, is editor of the 

 semiannual Railroad History; and John T. Schlebecker, Jr., Curator 

 of Agriculture, and G. Terry Sharrer, Curator of Manufacturing, 

 jointly edit the quarterly Living Historical Farms Bulletin. Robert P. 

 Multhauf continues as editor of ISIS and as advisory editor for the 

 Dictionary of Scientific Biography and the Dictionary of American 

 History. He was recently appointed a member of the Historical 

 Advisory Committee of nasa. 



The collections were enriched with a variety of objects ranging 

 in size from a 1926 Huber steam traction engine to an extremely 

 rare case bottle dated 1788 made at the Amelung Glass Factory of 

 Frederick, Maryland. An interesting collection of over 200 mill- 

 stones dating from 1748 to 1920 was acquired, including stones for 

 grinding materials ranging from grain to paint pigments. Collec- 

 tively, they represent an industry that no longer exists except as a 

 historical curiosity.

of Political History, together with several hundred political campaign 

 objects presented by Ralph E. Becker. A large and important collec- 

 tion of early photographic materials relating to the scientific investi- 

 gations of Professor John W. Draper, one of the first American re- 

 searchers to use photography as an investigative tool in scientific 

 investigations, was also acquired. 



A particularly valuable document, the original payroll of the Con 

 tinental gondola Philadelphia, was received through the generosity! 

 of the Trustees of the Fort Concho Museum at San Angelo, Texas. 

 This provides a new and human dimension to the history of this 

 national treasure. Also received was a specialized group of East 

 Asian paper currencies containing several thousand Chinese notes. 

 Combined with the Oriental coins already owned by the Division of 

 Numismatics, these materials form one of the most important refer- 

 ence collections for the student of Oriental monetary history. 



Among other significant items received were a rare eighteenth- 

 century indigo blue glazed wool counterpane and a number of horse- 

 drawn vehicles required to complete portions of the tranportation 

 collection, including a 1900 truck, an 1890 laundry wagon, a 1929 

 Cunningham touring car, and two horse-drawn cotton pickers. A 

 fine collection of scales and balances was received from the City of 

 Baltimore, together with instruments from the National Weather 

 Service. 



Baseball and archery collections, which were acquired this past 

 year, have developed a relatively new area of collection activity.

186 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




National Portrait Gallery 



The year began with the opening on the Fourth of July of a major 

 exhibition entitled "The Black Presence in the Era of the American 

 Revolution, 1770-1800," which consisted of more than 250 items: 

 paintings, prints, broadsides and books, documents and letters, 

 and three-dimensional objects. Professor Sidney Kaplan of the 

 University of Massachusetts prepared both the exhibition and its 

 catalogue, a 270-page volume containing 100 black and white 

 illustrations and 8 in color, published for the National Portrait 

 Gallery (npg) by the New York Graphic Society in association 

 with the Smithsonian Institution Press. Professor Kaplan, who 

 took a year's leave of absence from his post at Amherst College 

 to come to Washington, was the first of many scholars, experts 

 in their fields, whom we hope to call upon in connection with 

 special exhibitions and publications. "The Black Presence," like 

 all the Gallery's major exhibitions, also was accompanied by an 

 illustrated booklet and a teacher's guide, prepared especially for 

 the secondary-school level. This publication, 72 pages in length 

 and illustrated with 50 reproductions, was written by the Associate 

 Curator of Education, Mrs. Lisa W. Strick. 



A two-gallery exhibition, mounted to commemorate the 150th 

 anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine on December 3, was orga- 

 nized by a member of the staff of the Catalog of American Por- 

 traits, Gerald Z. Levin, who also prepared its 128-page catalogue. 

 The installations of this and "The Black Presence" exhibition were 

 designed by Joseph Michael Carrigan, Chief of Exhibit Design and 

 Production. 



A small exhibition dealing with the presidential portraiture of 

 Abraham Lincoln, centering on a full-length portrait of Lincoln 

 by William F. Cogswell, lent by the White House, was prepared 

 by two NPG interns, Richard Beard and Kenneth Yellis, who spent 

 a year with us under a grant from the National Endowment for 

 the Humanities. Beard and Yellis, who received their Master's 

 Degrees in History from Emory University and the University of 

 Rochester, respectively, were selected from nearly 100 candidates 

 who applied for these internships designed to acquaint the recipi- 

 ents with various phases of work encountered in a history museum. 



Several special portrait presentations also took place during the

year. The most notable of these was of a bust of President Lyndon

 Senator Hubert Humphrey spoke. 



In the past twelve months, more than 33,000 adults and young 

 people were served in the Gallery and in schoolrooms by our Edu- 

 cation Department — an increase of 300 percent over last year. 



The Historian's Office and the Curatorial Department were 

 mainly involved in the preparation of the first two in a series of 

 the Gallery's three Bicentennial exhibitions, "In the Minds and 

 Hearts of the People: Prologue to the American Revolution, 1760- 

 1774," and "The Dye is Now Cast, 1774-1776." The former, which 

 opened on June 14, will be discussed in greater detail in next year's 

 report. 



History and Art I 189 




That this was a banner year for the Gallery in terms of acquisi- 

 tions to the permanent collection is evidenced by the addition of 

 817 portraits, 761 of which were engravings by Charles Balthazar 

 Julien Fevret de Saint-Memin. Presented by Paul Mellon, this col- 

 lection represents the most munificent benefaction received by the 

 National Portrait Gallery since its inception. Originally owned by 

 Saint-Memin himself, these portraits, executed between 1796 and 

 1814, constitute a remarkably diverse representation of major 

 figures of the early Federal Republic, including Presidents Wash- 

 ington, Jefferson, and Madison; Paul Revere; Aaron Burr; Ben- 

 jamin Rush; John Marshall; Charles Willson Peale; Stephen De- 

 catur; Mother Seton; Meriwether Lewis; and William Clark. An- 

 other important gift was a portrait of Richard Henry Lee by 

 Charles Willson Peale, presented by Duncan C. Lee and his son 

 Gavin Dunbar Lee. Most notable among the year's acquisitions by 

 purchase were the only known life portrait of the first Speaker 

 of the House of Representatives Frederick Muhlenberg by Joseph 

 Wright, Dolley Madison (at the age of 83) by William S. Elwell, 

 a bust of Ralph Waldo Emerson by Daniel Chester French, a bronze 

 relief of President Theodore Roosevelt executed from life in 1906 

 by Sally James Farnham, and a group of drawings by Soss Melik 

 including likenesses of Sherwood Anderson, Cole Porter, and 

 Thomas Wolfe.

Office of Academic Studies 



The Office of Academic Studies, under the direction of the Board 

 of Academic Studies, conducts Smithsonian programs in higher 

 education and research training. The foremost objective of the 

 programs is to provide the framework within which each visiting 

 student and investigator can confront individually the opportunities 

 for the pursuit of knowledge represented in the Smithsonian's 

 collections and its research and technical staff. In the arts, humani- 

 ties, and sciences, students at all postsecondary levels study under 

 the guidance of the Smithsonian's professional research faculty. 



Predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows undertake research train- 

 ing in their specialties, bringing in their inquiries great intellectual 

 stimulation and adding immeasurably to the vitality of the research 

 climate. Predoctoral fellows generally consult Smithsonian re- 

 sources necessary to their dissertations but not available at their 

 universities. Postdoctoral fellows, usually recent recipients of the 

 doctorate, seek advanced research training and the opportunity to 

 expand studies begun at the university. During the academic year 

 1973-1974, 21 predoctoral and 24 postdoctoral fellowships were 

 awarded to support these activities in most of the museums, labora- 

 tories, and field stations of the Institution. 



Five students, in an earlier stage of graduate study than the 

 predoctoral fellows, have received fellowships supported jointly 

 by their home universities and the Smithsonian's National Air 

 and Space Museum to study aspects of the social and technological 

 impact of space exploration. Although pursuing degrees in different 

 disciplines at different Washington-area universities, the students 

 worked with each other as well as their Smithsonian advisor in 

 the development of their individual projects. 



Fellowship appointments for directed research are provided for 

 two to three months to graduate and undergraduate students, to 

 offer them new perspectives on the purposes of research and to 

 provide them access to sources and materials not encountered by 

 them in their university-based studies. Some students pursue in- 

 terests previously developed, but many explore areas of knowledge 

 wholly new. For example, a summer spent at the Smithsonian 

 might allow a first-year graduate student to reflect on the full 

 range of alternatives in his chosen field of knowledge, and to de- 



History and Art 1 191 




fine his future graduate course of study based on a better under- 

 standing of what he finds both practical and interesting. During 

 1973-1974 such awards were made to 21 graduate and under- 

 graduate students; 4 of the undergraduates were supported under 

 a grant from the National Science Foundation. 



Other students, often undergraduates, by preference undertake 

 studies at the Smithsonian which provide broader exposure than 

 research training. They are participants in a program for museum 

 study, a program offering them a chance to learn in the working 

 museum or laboratory or field environment rather than the tradi- 

 tional classroom atmosphere, to take part in the ongoing work, 

 of the Institution while pursuing a project that interests and I 

 challenges them. Most students in the program are awarded aca- 

 demic credit by their home universities, where the student's per- 

 formance meets the educational standards set by the Smithsonian 

 and the standards and requirements imposed by the university. 

 During the past year, 13 participated in museum-study projects 

 under the close supervision of Smithsonian staff members. 



In other undergraduate programs, two members of the Smith- 

 sonian staff taught regular courses in their specialties in the Uni- 

 versity of Maryland's program in the history of science and tech- 

 nology. 



Seeking other ways to encourage the interchange of ideas and 

 the exchange of information. Academic Studies supports visitors 

 to the Institution for very brief periods of study, research, and 

 consultation with the staff. The range of purposes and levels of 

 accomplishment of these visitors reflect the diversity of the Smith- 

 sonian itself, for they may be graduate students or distinguished 

 senior scholars and scientists, from the United States or abroad, 

 and their interests lead them to all areas of the Smithsonian. They 

 come here for their individual purposes, as short-term visitors, or 

 as participants in specialized seminars. This year support was pro- 

 vided for 32 short-term visitors, and for one seminar, conducted 

 by Dr. William Fitzhugh of the Smithsonian's Department of 

 Anthropology, on the topic of the Maritime and Moorehead 

 Archaic cultures of northeastern North America. 



192 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




, Office of American Studies 



The Office of American Studies conducts a formal graduate pro- 

 gram in material culture of the United States which is directed to 

 the original Smithsonian purpose: "the increase and diffusion of 

 knowledge." Graduate students from area universities participated 

 in the program, gaining academic credit toward advanced degrees 

 at those universities. 



The course in "Material Aspects of American Civilization" was 

 taught by Dr. Washburn (with the assistance of curators and others 

 inside and outside the Smithsonian). A seminar in Museum Visitor 

 Behavior was conducted by Robert A. Lakota and the staff of the 

 Psychological and Sociological Studies Program of the Office of 

 Museum Programs. A seminar in the decorative arts was conducted 

 by Patrick Butler III, Honorary Smithsonian Research Associate. 

 Arthur C. Townsend, Executive Secretary, Maryland Historical 

 Trust and Honorary Smithsonian Research Associate, repeated his 

 seminar in Great Plains history. A Work-Study Program in His- 

 torical Archeology, offered by the St. Mary's City Commission 

 in cooperation with the American Studies Program of the Smith- 

 sonian, George Washington University, and St. Mary's College 

 of Maryland, was held from June 17 to August 23, 1974, with 

 participation by graduate students and Smithsonian staff members. 

 In addition to these formal seminars, supervision of individual 

 reading and research projects, thesis direction, and preparation of 

 comprehensive examinations were undertaken by the director and 

 cooperating Smithsonian staff members. 



Staff publications for 1973-1974 are listed in Appendix 8.

 MUSEUM PROGRAMS 



Preservation, study, and interpretation are key functions in any 

 museum or museum system. The care with which objects are 

 registered, examined, and treated; the thoroughness with which 

 they are studied and the clarity with which they are presented and 

 interpreted to the pubHc are gauges to a museum's ultimate ex- 

 cellence. Yet, many of these functions take place away from public 

 view, with the attendant consequence that they are often funded 

 with inadequate resources or carried out in inadequate spaces. This 

 has intermittently occurred at the Smithsonian. The enormous 

 growth of activities which has developed in the last decade, the 

 acquisition of new collections, the founding and construction of 

 new museums as well as new fields of research which have opened 

 could well have justified, in the eyes of some, a slackening of efforts 

 and a shifting of resources to some immediately more glamorous 

 result. It is a measure of the historical commitment of the Institu- 

 tion to the search of excellence that this has not been the case. 



The last few years have seen increased emphasis given to de- 

 veloping the infrastructure in the fields of conservation, libraries, 

 archives, and more recently in registration. In these key areas major 

 progress was made in fiscal year 1974, 



The Smithsonian Library, which is as old as the Institution 

 itself, has undergone careful in-house examination and assessment 

 of its program and activities, aimed at refining its processes, maxi- 

 mizing its resources and responding more promptly to the needs 

 of the Institution and of the scholarly fraternity. Cooperation with 

 other libraries — federal, state, and private — has led to a pilot 

 program in computerized cataloguing which will vastly improve 

 the rate of processing as well as its quality. The needs of the rare 

 book collections, the ferreting out of uncatalogued rare materials. 



195 




and developing procedures for their conservation and restoration 

 have all made major strides. Greater attention has been paid to 

 the needs of Bureau libraries and to assisting them in responding 

 more promptly and fully to the requirements of their constituency. 

 Steps were taken which will lead to the complete cataloguing of 

 the important library of the National Air and Space Museum by 

 the dedication of its new building in July 1976. 



The Archives of the Institution, concerned primarily with its 

 history and the history of scholarship within it, have been brought 

 to virtually full intellectual control. Inventorying of archival re- 

 sources has progressed and computer systems have been developed 

 for their cataloguing in close cooperation with curatorial depart- 

 ments and the central and bureau libraries. 



Conservation, an ever present, indeed a growing concern to all 

 museums, has been further strengthened by enlarging the amount 

 of space allotted to the Conservation Analytical Laboratory, by 

 the purchase of more sensitive and highly specialized equipment, 

 and by the active recruitment of additional staff members. In spite 

 of the progress made, far more needs to be done. The present 

 capacity is hardly able to keep up with immediate, emergency 

 needs, let alone allow for the constant review required by such 

 varied collections as those possessed by the Institution. To maxi- 

 mize resources, avoid the possibilities of duplication, and to focus 

 more clearly on the needs, a Conservation Council was created 

 which regularly will assemble key conservators of all Smithsonian 

 museums. In addition, the staff of the Conservation Analytical 

 Laboratory has been active in assisting training organizations in 

 developing, as rapidly as possible, the additional professionals 

 which are urgently needed not only by the Institution but by 

 museums throughout the country. Conservation is more than the 

 monitoring of conditions and finding palliative methods to remedy 

 the desecrations of time or of man. It is also basic research in the 

 properties of materials and in the manners in which these materials 

 have been assembled by nature or by man. The Conservation 

 Analytical Laboratory has been under increasingly steady pressure 

 to provide technical data to bolster the hypotheses of historical re- 

 search or stylistic development. 



The processing of objects .either belonging to the Institution or 

 sent to the Institution for study or exhibition has been thoroughly 



196 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




reorganized. A registration capability is being developed in each 

 of the Smithsonian museums that did not have it so that each can 

 achieve more expeditious and accurate control on the whereabouts 

 of their holdings and, perhaps more important, monitor their con- 

 ditions in more efficient ways. A Registrarial Council has been 

 created to develop the required parameters. 



The foundations have been laid for the development of a Cen- 

 tral Registrar's Office that will help coordinate the growth of the 

 registrarial department in each of the museums, avoid duplications, 

 attain coherence in methods, and help develop basic retrieval sys- 

 tems which, eventually, may be coordinated with regional, national, 

 or, indeed, international data networks. The collections of the 

 Institution represent a data bank unequaled anywhere. The poten- 

 tial of mastering a substantial portion of this wealth by the means 

 of computers has already been demonstrated in discrete areas. 



Museums which are essential for the transmittal to the future 

 of the heritage of the past must, however, be of service to the 

 present. There is no contradiction in these terms as long as there 

 is a clear understanding of goals and integrity in their pursuit. 



Exhibition is a key function for a museum. In this area, also a 

 major reorganization has brought to each museum intellectual and 

 physical control over the resources with which it can interpret 

 its holdings. Certain museums and bureaus, either too small to have 

 an exhibition resource of their own or that have too infrequent 

 need for such specialized capabilities, are served by the recently 

 developed Office of Exhibits Central. Some of its specialized shops, 

 virtually unmatched for their abilities, particularly in the area 

 of modeling and plastics, serve the entire family of Smithsonian 

 museums. This office also has more general workshops which pro- 

 vide design and construction capabilities to those units that do not 

 have exhibit departments. The reorganization of the Office of 

 Exhibits has led to closer cooperation between design and cura- 

 torial staffs. 



The Office of Exhibits Central and the exhibit offices in various 

 museums are contributing and participating in the psychological 

 studies conducted by the Office of Museum Programs. These stud- 

 ies are specifically designed to acquire more information about 

 museums as a learning environment and to developing more re- 

 sponsive methods for orientation of the museum visitor. These 



Museum Programs 1 197 




studies, which are now coming to fruition, will undoubtedly result 

 in new exhibit concepts and forms of presentation. Their timeliness 

 is evident since the Institution is gearing toward an unprecedented 

 efflorescence of exhibition activities which will culminate in the 

 Bicentennial Year. 



For the past decade, the Institution has recognized that it had a 

 duty to assist those less wealthy institutions around the country 

 in presenting to their public a richer fare. This concern took on 

 concrete and permanent form with the development of the Smith- 

 sonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service. This has made 

 available hundreds of exhibitions of high quality, at modest cost, 

 to museums, historical societies, colleges, universities, and cultural 

 centers. The efficacy of sites had, in the last few years, been 

 increasingly jeopardized as costs increased and borrowing organi- 

 zations were unable to assume the rental fees which were neces- 

 sary for a break-even program. Federal funding of sites, for the 

 first time in fiscal year 1974, has helped to maintain a balance. 

 Between now and the end of the Bicentennial Year, approximately 

 250 new exhibitions will be developed on various subjects con- 

 cerned with history, art, and science. Major emphasis has and will 

 be given to incorporating into traveling exhibitions Smithsonian 

 concepts and, where appropriate, objects so that the Institution's 

 resources on the Mall can be shared more broadly with the Nation 

 at large. Many of these new exhibitions will be built by the Office 

 of Exhibits Central, to concepts and specifications provided by 

 SITES. To increase the educational usefulness of these exhibitions, 

 kits of educational materials, designed for schools, will be pre- 

 pared and an increasingly large number of sites exhibitions will 

 be accompanied by didactic materials which will be geared to vari- 

 ous levels so that the broadest benefit can be derived by their 

 presence. 



Assisting museums in developing the expertise of their staff 

 or in solving special problems has been another historic service of 

 the Institution. In the last few years, it has been rationalized by 

 the Office of Museum Programs through the presentation of work- 

 shops, available free of charge to museum personnel from across 

 the country. This program, increased in effectiveness in 1974, will 

 be broadened in the years ahead. Disseminating knowledge on 

 conservation through expertly prepared series of slide lectures is 



198 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




another service recently developed. This will be supplemented by 

 upward of 40 video-taped programs on the basic principles of con- 

 servation and conservation practice. These programs will be avail- 

 able to museums, historical societies, and other interested groups. 



The study of the museum as a learning environment, referred to 

 above, has led to staff participation in several seminars, and a 

 series of short articles were published in Museum News. A major 

 monograph by Dr. Chandler Screven, The Measurement and Facili- 

 tation of Learning in the Museum Environment: An Experimental 

 Analysis, is under preparation for publication by the Office of Mu- 

 seum Programs. 



The National Museum Act, first funded in fiscal year 1972, 

 continued to be administered by the Office of Museum Programs 

 and chaired by the Assistant Secretary. The contribution of the 

 Act to professional enhancement has been universally recognized 

 and has been most visible in the number of workshops, funded 

 under the Act, that have been held around the country under the 

 auspices of the American Association of Museums, the American 

 Association for State and Local History, or other organizations. 

 Developing new training programs and attracting talented new 

 minds to the profession are challenges which museums must meet. 

 The Act has provided a mechanism to assist in these developments 

 and in carrying out special research on museum problems and 

 opportunities. 



Renovation and restoration of the Arts and Industries Building, 

 in preparation for the Bicentennial Year, is another major respon- 

 sibility of the Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs. This 

 building, the second structure on the Mall built for the Smith- 

 sonian Institution, was opened to the public in 1881. It was erected 

 to house the vast collections which were acquired after the closing 

 of the centennial exhibit of 1876 at Philadelphia. 



Appropriately, the first major exhibition to be shown in the 

 renovated Arts and Industries Building will be devoted to the 

 recreation, in capsule form, of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibit. 

 That summary of the Industrial Revolution's accomplishments 

 and the Western Hemisphere's no doubt will be the cause of much 

 nostalgia and pride. 



The Assistant Secretary has continued to represent the Secre- 

 tary on the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation and on its 



Museum Programs 1 199 




International Centre Committee. He participated actively in a num- 

 ber of professional organizations notably as Vice-President of the 

 American Association of Museums, Vice-Chairman of the Inter- 

 national Council of Museums Committee of the aam, and Chairman 

 of the AAM Professional Relations' Committee. 



He was elected a member of the Council of the International 

 Centre for the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property, 

 Rome, and Vice-President of the International Council of Museums, 

 Paris. 



Conservation- Analytical Laboratory 



The activities of the Conservation-Analytical Laboratory (cal) 

 support researches in many areas of the Smithsonian — some 30 

 Divisions in any one year. It would not be proper to reveal some 

 of these in advance of publication by the principal investigator. 

 Others follow. 



CAL has investigated the use of neutron-activation and electron- 

 microprobe analysis of various panes of glass in a medieval window 

 for the purpose of detecting replacements, investigating early tech- 

 nology, and with a view to attributing panes to particular work- 

 shops. 



An analysis has been recently published on the ink of the Vin- 

 land Map. Another interpretation of the results appeared possible. 

 The possibility has been investigated, using microchemical, micro- 

 scopic and X-ray diffraction techniques. 



Elemental analyses of majolica ware have revealed the possibility 

 of distinguishing between Spanish and Colonial-Mexican origins 

 for particular specimens. 



New X-ray fluorescence equipment for the rapid analysis of 

 objects has been installed and is being brought into service. Some 

 early results in the difficult field of analyzing liquid measures made 

 of pewter have indicated distinct differences in composition for 

 measures of English and Scottish origin. 



An iron ball, golf-ball size, that sounded musically when it was 

 struck, was submitted for suggestions about its nature. X-radiog- 

 raphy discovered a sounding spiral-wire and loose ball inside.

A view of the X-ray Laboratory, Conservation-Analytical Laboratory, Smith- 

 sonian Institution. On the left a pewter vessel is exposed to a beam of 

 X-radiation and gives out secondary radiation characteristic of the elements 

 present within it. This secondary radiation is received by a solid-state detector 

 kept cold by a Dewar vessel of liquid nitrogen. The energy-dispersed spectrum 

 is displayed on a monitor screen (on the right hand side of the picture) above 

 a control panel. The spectra from two different samples can be stored in 

 separate memories and displayed together for comparison by using the control 

 panel, which can also superimpose markers on the screen representative of 

 various elements. The operator is seated at a Telex keyboard, which is used 

 to communicate with the mini-computer behind it. Results of computations 

 made upon data obtained from the display screen are. printed out on paper 

 from the roll. 




Examination of samples provided from Eastern gongs has re- 

 vealed a metallurgical structure that has received very little notice 

 in the literature. 



A Peale drawing submitted for treatment was found by exami- 

 nation in infrared light to contain an earlier version. Careful pho- 

 tography using infrared light has now enabled exhibit of both 

 versions, possibly drawn by father and son. 



An important payroll had been written in iron-gall ink on paper 

 so very acid that washing was desirable. Tests of the ink-line re- 

 vealed that it could be damaged by water, so a safer washing pro- 

 cedure was devised. 



A series of elaborate Western saddles in decaying condition, 

 embellished with silver and other threads and metallic plaques, 

 have presented numerous technical problems of identification and 

 treatment in the course of cleaning and repair for exhibition. 



Close examination of an eighteenth-century harpsichord-stand 

 preliminary to restoration revealed several phases of earlier 

 rebuilding. 



National Museum Act Program 



The National Museum Act, authorized in 1966, received an appro- 

 priation of $901,000 in fiscal year 1974. In accordance with the 

 legislation, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National 

 Endowment for the Humanities each received $100,000 from the 

 above sum. Under the legislation, the Smithsonian may grant funds 

 to specific projects that advance the museum profession at large, 

 either through research, training, or publication. Every proposal 

 funded must clearly describe how it will upgrade the museum 

 profession — its techniques, approaches, and methods. 



A total of 182 applications were received and reviewed by the 

 Advisory Council who recommended funding for 64 projects. The 

 Advisory Council consists of museum professionals representing 

 different aspects and areas of the museum field — art, science, 

 history, education, conservation, and exhibition. The Council mem- 

 bers in 1974 were: William T. Alderson, Director, American Asso- 

 ciation of State and Local History; Charles E. Buckley, Director, 



202 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




St. Louis Museum of Art and President, American Association of 

 Museums; W. D. Frankforter, Director, Grand Rapids Public 

 Museum; Lloyd Hezekiah, Director, Brooklyn Children's Museum; 

 Lawrence J. Majewski, Chairman, Conservation Center, Institute 

 of Fine Arts, New York University; Giles W. Mead, Director, Los 

 Angeles County Museum of Natural History; T. Miake, Director 

 of Programs, Ontario Science Museum; Arminta Neal, Curator 

 of Graphics Design, Denver Museum of Natural History; Barnes 

 Riznik, Vice President, Old Sturbridge Village; Frank Taylor, 

 Research Associate, Smithsonian Institution; Vernal T. Yadon, 

 Director, Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History; and Paul N. 

 Perrot, Chairman, and Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs, 

 Smithsonian Institution. 



In 1974, the Advisory Council added a new program — Travel 

 Grants for Beginning Professionals. Persons who have been gain- 

 fully employed by the profession for not more than four consecu- 

 tive years and not less than one year are eligible for grant con- 

 sideration under this program. The objective of this program is 

 to provide individuals with the opportunity to broaden their knowl- 

 edge and acquaint themselves with specific operations in other 

 museums and institutions. Twenty-seven grants were awarded in 

 this area. 



Special attention was given to Research in Conservation Tech- 

 niques and Materials. Six projects were funded in this category 

 including. Dating by Thermoluminescence, the Use of Trialkoxy- 

 alkylsilanes for the Conservation of Stone, and Control of Shock 

 and Vibration of Objects in Transit. 



The National Museum Act continues its strong support for publi- 

 cations to distribute technical information on a broad scale. In 

 addition to support for technical articles as a supplement to Museum 

 News, two books. Museum Trustees Handbook and Rene d' Harnon- 

 court: His Art of Installation, and a monograph. Collective Bargain- 

 ing in Museums were funded. 



Seminars, especially those providing in-service training to mem- 

 bers of the profession, received special emphasis. Eighteen work- 

 shops covering such topics as museum education, fund raising, 

 registration methods, zoo management, administration, publication 

 programs, docent programs, museum architecture, and Bicentennial 

 program planning were a part of the seminar program.

Office of Exhibits Central 



The newly established Office of Exhibits Central (oec) assisted 

 almost every office of the Smithsonian Institution during its first 

 full year of operation. The Special Exhibit Resources Group — 

 which includes the Models, Plastics, and Restoration Shops and 

 Freeze Dry Laboratory, the Motion Picture Unit, Museum Light- 

 ing Office, Audio Visual Unit, and Exhibits Editor's Office — 

 provided service and consultation in their specializations on a wide 

 variety of projects to each Smithsonian Museum on the Mall. The 

 Central Design and Production Group greatly increased the sup- 

 port of programs for the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Ex- 

 hibition Service, the National Zoological Park, and the Division 

 of Performing Arts' Festival of American Folklife. Both groups 

 with the administrative staff of the oec developed shop facilities 

 and procedures during this period and continued to refine operations 

 to meet the increasing needs of Smithsonian bureaus and offices. 



The Twenty-fourth Street facility was activated for fabrication 

 and graphic production and is now fully operational. The Adminis- 

 trative, Design, and Editor's offices are located in the Arts and 

 Industries Building and the Special Resources shops and labora- 

 tories continue to function in their former locations at the National 

 Museum of Natural History, and the National Museum of History 

 and Technology. 



The Office of Exhibits Central recorded 156 project requests in 

 its first year and completed 95 of these. Of the balance, several 

 are long-range or Bicentennial programs of the Institution. Main- 

 taining a philosophy of operational flexibility and improving an 

 ability to perform unique tasks wherever needed, the oec is devel- 

 oping plans and activities with its client organizations within the 

 Institution for both long-range and specialized exhibition services. 



Office of Museum Programs 



The Office of Museum Programs, as part of the Office of the 

 Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs, is an aggregate of 

 programs responsible for coordinating activities related to training 



204 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




in muscology and museography, and the development of new tech- 

 niques relating to museum administration and practices. Presently, 

 the office maintains three major programs — the Museum Work- 

 shop Program, the Conservation Information Program, and the 

 Psychological Studies Program. 



The Museum Workshop Program offers workshops, seminars, 

 and training courses to any individual gainfully employed by a 

 museum. Each workshop, taught by Smithsonian staff, is devoted 

 to specific methods or problems. Enrollment is limited, and instruc- 

 tors try to concentrate on the particular needs of each participant. 

 Special attention is usually given to the problems of the small 

 museum's budget, services, and facilities. Workshops offered this 

 year featured: exhibit design, graphics techniques, silk screening, 

 label writing, editing and production, fabrication and installation 

 methods, model-making, freeze-drying, membership programs, 

 traveling exhibitions, development and financial planning, and 

 psychological methods. 



The Conservation Information Program is another service de- 

 signed to make the knowledge and facilities of the Smithsonian 

 accessible to as large an audience as possible. The program 

 acquaints small museums, interested organizations, and individuals 

 with selected theoretical and practical principles currently practiced 

 in the field of museum conservation. This information — in the 

 form of video-taped programs and slide lectures accompanied by 

 tape commentaries — is lent, free of charge, to all who request it. 

 To date, the Conservation Information Program, in cooperation 

 with the Smithsonian Institution Conservation-Analytical Labora- 

 tory, has produced 4 slide presentations on the curatorial care of 

 objects and 10 more are being prepared during the next year. Some 

 selected subjects include: dry methods in the cleaning of prints, 

 drawings, and manuscripts; proper mounting and matting of 

 drawings, and manuscripts; proper mounting and matting of paper; 

 the protective lining of a wooden storage drawer for textiles and 

 costumes; and the wet cleaning of antique cotton, linen and wool. 



The Psychological Studies Program provides both direct and 

 evaluative services to the Smithsonian Institution and engages in 

 applied behavior research for broader application to museum pro- 

 fessional practices. The staff designs and tests museum behavior 

 studies which aid (1) the study of the museum as an institution for 



Museum Programs I 205 




the preservation, interpretation, and exhibition of objects, and (2) 

 the construction of several practical and effective visitor-behavior 

 projects employing some of the methods of social science that the 

 museum professional can undertake in his own museum or gallery. 

 The Psychological Studies Program analyzes visitor behavior, 

 especially that of communication. Investigations gauge the educa- 

 tional effectiveness of exhibits and exhibit techniques. The Program 

 is also concerned with the problem of visitor orientation, that is, 

 how to initiate the visitor into the museum experience for optimum 

 use of his time and interests. The primary testing grounds for 

 research activities have been the National Museum of Natural 

 History, the National Museum of History and Technology, and the 

 Renwick Gallery of the National Collection of Fine Arts. Subjects 

 examined in nmnh were: the relative effectiveness of different ex- 

 hibit halls; visitor characteristics most likely to determine visitor 

 behavior; and the relationship between the physical layout, famil- 

 iarity and attractiveness of exhibit halls, and the visitors' behavior 

 within them. At nmht, the staff analyzed traffic flow, crowding, 

 attraction and holding power of exhibits, orientation within the 

 gallery, the effectiveness of different kinds of labels, use of facili- 

 ties, and causes of visitor fatigue. Visitor learning and ways of 

 facilitating it were tested for two years at the Renwick. 



Office of the Registrar 



The Smithsonian is evaluating and improving its registration sys- 

 tem. The Office of the Registrar, which dates back at least to the 

 1880s once kept records on all specimens and administered all 

 shipping for the Smithsonian. New museums, increases in curatorial 

 staff, and increased accession rates have outpaced the development 

 of the Central Registrar's office. Presently actions are underway to 

 break with old traditions. During 1973, the Council of Registrars, 

 which represents most museums in the Smithsonian complex, made 

 thorough studies of several registration problems and made exten- 

 sive reports to the Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs. 

 These recommendations are the initial steps toward beneficial 

 change in the Institution's registration system. 



206 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




Although yet a vision rather than a reaUty, the new order of 

 registration at the Smithsonian is discernible, and it is the goal 

 toward which present activities are directed. Each museum will 

 have a registration staff adequate to ensure proper documentation 

 of all acquisitions and to work with curators and conservators to 

 ensure the security and availability of specimens. The Central 

 Registrar will have several functions. As the senior registrar, he 

 will assist museums with their registration problems and he will 

 develop new registration techniques as required by the complexities 

 of the national collections. Most important of all, the Central 

 Registrar will take an Institution-wide view of the national collec- 

 tions and the systems which protect and service these resources. 



Thus, the primary achievement of fiscal year 1974 was careful 

 development of goals. 



Smithsonian Institution Archives 



During fiscal 1974 the Smithsonian Archives continued its efforts 

 to gain intellectual control of Archives throughout the Institution. 

 Work continued on records of the National Museum of Natural His- 

 tory, where an intensive survey revealed that some 6.5 million docu- 

 ments remain unprocessed and in need of archival preservation. 



The National Museum of History and Technology presents an 

 archival challenge unique among Smithsonian bureaus, because it 

 is the only bureau which maintains a major manuscript collecting 

 program in addition to creating its own administrative records. 

 During 1974 the Archives staff began a major effort to aid in the 

 care and preservation of those materials. A consultant employed by 

 the Archives surveyed the records and manuscript holdings of the 

 Science and Technology Department, and submitted a report to the 

 Director of the National Museum of History and Technology, 

 which will serve as the basis for policy decisions defining the role 

 of the Archives in the National Museum of History and Technology. 



The Archives made provisions to care for the records of the 

 National Collection of Fine Arts and the National Portrait Gallery, 

 as well as the National Air and Space Museum. 



Museum Programs I 207 




Many other ongoing programs continued, with emphasis on mi- 

 crofilming and efforts to develop computerized finding aids to the 

 Archives' holdings. Arrangement and microfilming of the accession 

 records continued and the specimen catalogues of several divisions 

 in the National Museum of Natural History were filmed. 



Smithsonian Institution Libraries 



Nineteen seventy-four was a year of staff participation and a year 

 of experimentation in new forms of operations and services. During 

 the first half of the year the Libraries' staff took part in a study of 

 the Libraries' management. A report was submitted to the Director 

 of Libraries in January 1974, and after discussions with the staff, 

 the Director of Libraries accepted more than fifty of the study's 

 recommendations. The recommendations are being implemented by 

 the Libraries' administrators. An Implementation Assessment 

 Group, appointed to monitor the progress of implementation, is to 

 make periodic reports to the Director of Libraries and to the staff. 

 This management study introduced an atmosphere of staff partici- 

 pation in decision making. 



The most promising technical development was the Libraries' 

 experiment with the Ohio College Library Center (oclc) on-line 

 cataloguing system. This system produces catalogue cards for- 

 matted to Smithsonian specifications faster and more efficiently 

 than the previously used manual procedures. Furthermore, the oclc 

 system, which provides on-line access to a large and growing 

 bibliographic data base, has facilitated the process of ordering 

 library materials. The introduction of this system has effected some 

 experiments in workflow and staffing patterns to permit more 

 efficient use of personnel. The staff is now assessing the effective- 

 ness of the OCLC system and is planning for expansion of automated 

 systems. 



Throughout the year, bureau and branch librarians met to dis- 

 cuss common problems. For the first time, librarians responsible for 

 the development and maintenance of library collections in various 

 bureaus and departments participated in the allocation of book and 

 binding funds for the Libraries. The Deputy Assistant Director for 



208 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




Bureau Services has initiated cooperative efforts to formulate a 

 library collection development policy for the Institution. 



Services to users have been augmented. For example, the 

 National Air and Space Museum Library produces a current aware- 

 ness list; users in the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and 

 Radiation Biology Laboratory Libraries are provided with individ- 

 ually profiled current awareness services; librarians at the National 

 Zoological Park and Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute index 

 relevant literature for their users. 



Librarians serving bureaus and departments of the Institution 

 have been attempting to become more closely involved with pro- 

 grams and plans of the bureaus which they serve. The National 

 Air and Space Museum librarian serves as Chairperson of the 

 NASM Collection Development Committee; both the National Air 

 and Space Museum and National Collection of Fine Arts/National 

 Portrait Gallery librarians attend staff meetings held by their 

 bureau directors; at the request of the National Museum of History 

 and Technology librarian, a library committee of curators has been 

 formed to advise the bureau librarian. 



In spite of a limited budget for the purchase of books and 

 journals, the Libraries continued to acquire many of the materials 

 required to support Smithsonian Institution programs. To a large 

 extent, important gifts and the Libraries' well-established exchange 

 program made this possible. The year saw exchange programs 

 initiated with the People's Republic of China and with the Museums 

 and Monuments Office in Ghana. 



The binding and preservation program of the Libraries has been 

 hampered for a number of years by lack of adequate funds. In 

 anticipation of increased support, binding and preservation needs 

 have been assessed. The program to identify and preserve rare 

 books in the Institution continued. 



One area of concern expressed in the Libraries' management 

 study was the personnel program. As a result, some changes in 

 personnel policies and staffing are being tested and a Staff Develop- 

 ment Committee has been appointed. 



The Libraries supported staff participation in continuing educa- 

 tion and professional activities such as seminars, conferences, 

 meetings, and training courses. Twenty-six Libraries' staff members 



Museum Programs I 209 




attended training courses funded by the Libraries. Several staff 

 members have received outstanding professional recognition. 

 Catherine Scott, nasm bureau librarian, is a member of the Board 

 of Visitors of Catholic University of America Library and a member 

 of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. 

 William Walker, ncfa/npg librarian, is Vice Chairman Elect of 

 the Art Libraries Society of North America (arlis/na). Elaine Sloan, 

 Assistant to the Director for Planning and Research, received a 

 Ph.D. in Library and Information Services from the University of 

 Maryland. Dr. Russell Shank, Director of Libraries, completed his 

 term as President of the Association of College and Research 1 

 Libraries and was elected Vice President, President Elect of the 

 United States Book Exchange. Dr. Shank was the recipient of a 

 fellowship from the Council of Library Resources and was granted 

 sabbatical leave by the Smithsonian from February to September, 

 1974, to study the implications of telecommunications policy for 

 libraries and information resources. Jean Chandler Smith, Assistant 

 Director for Bureau Services, was appointed Acting Director of 

 Libraries. 



Among the many distinguished visitors to the Smithsonian 

 Institution Libraries was a delegation of heads of libraries from 

 the People's Republic of China. The Libraries provided graduate 

 library school students opportunities for study and field work. As 

 part of a training program, two American Indians from Navajo 

 Community College Library worked in the Anthropology, nmht, 

 and NASM Libraries.

Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service 



The Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (sites) cir- 

 culates more shows on more subjects to more people than anyone 

 else. It is unique in that it circulates exhibitions of history, science, 

 and technology in addition to exhibitions on art. 



This past year, several new initiatives were undertaken as a re- 

 sponse to the needs of sites' customers. Each new effort had to be 

 oriented philosophically and financially to the Smithsonian's effort 

 to increase as well as diffuse knowledge. 



This year, sites received its first direct federal appropriation. Ful- 

 filling a promise to Congress, appropriated funds were directed 

 toward keeping rental fees within the range of medium and small 

 institutions that count on the Smithsonian for high quality exhibi- 

 tions. Further, federal funds were used to improve exhibition quality 

 by expanding programming and educational activities suggestions 

 to more effectively use the circulating shows. 



The primary responsibility for the development of these materials 

 is being pursued by a Program Coordinator, a new position on the 

 Traveling Exhibition Service staff. It has been determined that there 

 are far too many projects for one such position and plans have been 

 made to add more persons in the future. 



sites representatives were present at each of the six regional meet- 

 ings of the American Association of Museums this year. Inquiries 

 about sites' program and consultation to others on the travel of 

 shows were provided. A significant amount of foreign as well as 

 domestic travel was undertaken to assure that sites standards were 

 upheld in the preparation of shows for travel. In addition to many of 

 the 50 states and Puerto Rico, sites staff worked with exhibition 

 sources in Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Austria, Great Britain, Nor- 

 way, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand. Four members of the sites 

 staff attended the American Association of Museums national meet- 

 ing in Fort Worth, Texas, and a delegate was sent to the International 

 Council of Museums meeting in Copenhagen. 



A Bicentennial Exhibitions effort was launched this year with the 

 assignment of two full-time -staff members to this program. Two 

 exhibitions especially mounted for the Bicentennial began their tours. 



A major program to improve sites' exhibition offerings in science 



214 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




was begun. A National Science Foundation grant to develop a series 

 of exhibitions with the topic of "Understanding the Environment" 

 provided the major impetus for the program. 



A week-long workshop on the travel of exhibitions was held at 

 SITES headquarters in April 1974, Nine representatives from mu- 

 seums in the United States, one from Puerto Rico, and two from 

 Canada participated. 



SITES concluded the year having booked over 600 exhibitions 

 viewed by an estimated 4,800,000 persons. There are now 2,600 

 institutions on sites mailing lists. At the end of the year, 109 exhibi- 

 tions were in circulation. During the twelve-month period, 28 exhi- 

 bitions were produced for tour and 3 were refurbished for extended 



In fiscal year 1974, approximately $250,000 in grants, gifts, and 

 contracts were received to develop exhibitions and educational pro- 

 grams. With the federal appropriation, these funds had the effect of 

 making sites exhibitions more accessible than ever before.

Smithsonian Year '1974 

 PUBLIC SERVICE 



During the past 12 months an exciting fermentation has begun in 

 the area of Public Service. This activity is in response to the impact 

 of a larger public interest in a more extensive Smithsonian Institu- 

 tion, and, in equal measure, to a notably more discerning public 

 interest in the educational potential of the Smithsonian museums 

 and galleries, and their programs. In building the resources and the 

 organization to meet these challenges, the Public Service divisions 

 are helping to bring into balance the Institution's fulfillment of Mr. 

 Smithson's mandate for the diffusion of knowledge as well as its 

 increase. 



For, basically, the role of Public Service is education, and Smith- 

 sonian educational activity has been mushrooming as the desire of 

 the American public of all ages to be educated has burgeoned in one 

 of the liveliest social phenomena of our time. During the year, 21 

 Smithsonian bureaus conducted specifically educational programs 

 which reached a total of close to 300,000 people. These were by no 

 means all Public Service functions, but all complemented the direct 

 educational role of the Office of Public Service. Our view, in fact, is 

 that our major museum and gallery directors are the best qualified 

 to develop education programs related to their collections or re- 

 searches. In consequence, we decentralized the Office of Elementary 

 and Secondary Education and thereby made people and money avail- 

 able for the establishment of education speciahst positions and sup- 

 porting sections in all of the principal museums and galleries. A 

 comparable reorganization is being considered for the Office of 

 Public Affairs; in addition, the funds formerly allotted to the Smith- 

 sonian Institution Press and divided by the Director of the Press 

 among interested bureaus will henceforth be distributed directly to 



217 




bureau chiefs so that each may determine his own publishing priori- 

 ties. Such changes permit us to reorganize the central offices of the 

 Office of Elementary and Secondary Education and ultimately of 

 the Office of PubHc Affairs so that their efforts can be focused on 

 Institution-wide requirements. 



The twin challenges posed by Smithsonian growth and by the ap- 

 proach of the Bicentennial have stimulated every one of the Public 

 Service divisions, as will be evident in the following accounts. At 

 the end of fiscal 1974 Smithsonian (magazine) circulation and Na- 

 tional Associate membership exceeded 600,000 and was steadily 

 climbing; Resident Associate membership topped 20,000; Division 

 of Performing Arts-produced Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz 

 had sold 30,000 copies; and a striking further demonstration of 

 public enthusiasm for Office of Public Service programs was evident 

 in the long queues which formed before each of the 7 daily show- 

 ings of the Ascent of Man film series, arranged by the Office of 

 PubUc Service Free Film Theatre. In addition, not only the Public 

 Service bureaus but the entire Institution is preparing for the antici- 

 pated results of the Smithsonian television series which will begin in 

 the fall of 1974 and will bring Smithsonian treasures and Smith- 

 sonian interests to 20 to 40 million television viewers across the 

 Nation. Every increase in public interest in the Smithsonian gener- 

 ates a requirement for service to that public, whether it be the 

 development of new educational facilities or simply the organization 

 and staffing of an office to reply to the increase in letters of inquiry 

 or suggestion addressed to the Smithsonian. 



Fiscal year 1974 did bring one reduction in the organizational 

 makeup of the Office of Public Service with the very appropriate 

 transfer of the Office of International Activities to the Office of the 

 Secretary for Science. 



Finally, the Office of Public Services wishes to express its warm 

 appreciation to the 1120 dedicated members of the Smithsonian vol- 

 unteers and the 530 Smithsonian volunteer docents who gave so 

 much of their time and service to the Institution during 1974, and 

 without whose help "Smithsonian Public Service" would have a far 

 more limited connotation.

 Three Out of Many — Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria." 




Anacostia Neighborhood Museum 



The Anacostia Neighborhood Museum now in its sixth year has 

 continued to enrich the experience of museum visitors with a 

 variety of exhibits and educational programs. 



The year was highhghted by a series of major exhibitions. "The 

 Evolution of a Community, Part 11" communicated areas of con- 

 cern that were relevant to all urban communities. It represented the 

 shared feelings of the people of Anacostia concerning housing, 

 unemployment, education, drug abuse, and crime. "Africa: Three 

 Out of Many" represented the African language of art in its three- 

 dimensional forms of sculpture and masks. The art, the religious 

 inspirations, history, and culture depicted the people of Ethiopia, 

 Ghana, and Nigeria — the three countries selected from many 

 African nations. 



The Barnett-Aden collection of paintings, sculptures, and prints 

 was shown. The collection reflected the talents and concerns of an 

 exciting group of American arid Afro- American artists who emerged 

 from the period which historians call the "Harlem Renaissance." 



220 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




Exhibits at the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, "Africa: Three Out of 

 Many — Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria" (opposite page) and "The Barnett-Aden 

 Collection" held January 20 to May 6, 1974, attracted many visitors. The latter 

 proved to be an important art event in the Metropolitan area. 



A variety of educational programs and films of popular interest 

 were given during each exhibit and throughout the year. Over 

 40,000 children and teenagers participated in these activities. 



The Mobile Division continues to take the museum to the 

 people. Portable exhibits, teaching aids, demonstrations, and a 

 Speakers' Bureau are all included in its outreach program. 



The history of the Anacostia community is presently being 

 researched for a publication entitled Anacostia Story, which is 

 being prepared for the Bicentennial. Anacostia Neighborhood 

 Museum is also looking forward to completion in 1974 of the 

 construction of an Exhibits Design and Production Laboratory 

 where, in addition to the preparation and production of exhibits 

 for the Museum, an exhibits training program will train minority 

 members in the arts and crafts of museum design and production. 

 This laboratory, when in operation, will provide improved facilities 

 for experimentation in exhibit design and production, which has 

 been a goal of the Museum since its inception.

Division of Performing Arts 



Expanding the Institution's role as conservator and preserver of the 

 Nation's creative forces, the Division of Performing Arts presented 

 the Seventh consecutive Festival of American FolkHfe, which has 

 become the largest summertime event in the Nation's Capital, and 

 six different series and numerous individual events during the 

 winter programs. 



During the 1973-1974 season, 15,000 people attended concerts 

 offering a range of creative musical expressions from baroque to 

 bluegrass, as well as the second season of Jazz Heritage Concerts. 

 Such artists as Leon Fleisher and the Theater Chamber Players, 

 Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys, Earl Brown, Earl Hines, and 

 Carmen McRae were presented. Most concerts were preceded by 

 free public workshops. To cope with capacity audiences, work- 

 shops had to be moved from the Hall of Musical Instruments to 

 the Baird Auditorium midway through the season. 



A new recording program instituted by the Division issued a 

 historic first, the Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz, a boxed, 

 six-record set including 85 selections from 17 record companies. 

 The set was produced by Martin Williams, Director of the Jazz 

 Program. Receiving critical acclaim and an unprecedented number 

 of orders, the Collection is now in its third printing. 



The Smithsonian Resident Puppet Theater, one of two con- 

 tinuously operated puppet theaters in the country, attracted 3000 

 visitors each week to three different shows: Patchwork, an impro- 

 visational series with music, Pinocchio, a new version of the classic, 1 

 and What If?...,a puppet science-fiction fantasy. The Perform- 

 ing Arts Division contributes to a "lively mall" area through the 

 operation of the carousel and the original old-time popcorn 

 machine. 



Performing Arts shares the American experience in its many 

 creative forms with museum visitors and people across the Nation 

 through the Smithsonian Touring Performance Service, offering 

 performances not available through commercial management to 

 museums, colleges, universities, and cultural centers. The 1973- 

 1974 season saw 51 performances sent to 23 states, by the Smith- 

 sonian Puppet Theater, The American Folklife Company, High-

woods String Band, Horace Silver, Jean Ritchie, and others. A post- 

 Festival tour of Serbo-Croatian musicians traveling to ethnic 

 comnrunities in 6 cities became a pilot project which will service 

 increased requests from state and local communities for Smith- 

 sonian aid in booking Bicentennial programs. 



The Seventh Festival of American Folklife featured a new site, an 

 expanded schedule, and new themes leading to a season-long Bicen- 

 tennial Festival in 1976. The 1973 presentation focused on four 

 theme areas that would be expanded for the Bicentennial: Old 

 Ways in the New World, Working Americans, Native Americans, 

 and Regional America. The Smithsonian was joined by the National 

 Park Service as a co-sponsor. Called the "great national family 

 reunion," the Festival attracted 1.3 million visitors, who came to 

 learn more about themselves and about others from the United 

 States and around the world. 



Office of Elementary and Secondary Education 



Fiscal year 1974 has brought new directions and new challenges to 

 the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. As recently 

 redefined, the Office is now a service unit, charged with giving 

 assistance, upon request, to the Bureau education offices of all of 

 the Smithsonian museums, the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environ- 

 mental Studies, and the National Zoo. 



A primary responsibility of the Office of Elementary and 

 Secondary Education (oese) is to encourage cooperation and ex- 

 change of information among the Smithsonian education offices 

 and between those offices and the District of Columbia area 

 schools. Toward this end, a number of efforts are underway. Two 

 publications — a monthly newsletter. Let's Go, and an annual 

 brochure. Learning Opportunities for Schools — inform teachers of 

 Smithsonian programs and other activities of particular interest to 

 young people and contain suggestions for using museums as 

 educational resources. The publications are sent free of charge to 

 over 1300 area schools. In addition, an annual Museum Education 

 Day is held for teachers, school administrators, and museum educa- 

 tors. This year's event, which took place at the National Portrait 

 Gallery and the National Collection of Fine Arts, presented a 



Public Service I 225 




selection of art, history, and science programs offered to school 

 groups by the various education offices. A folk-music workshop, a 

 Japanese tea ceremony, and a reenactment of the trial of aboli- 

 tionist John Brown were among the programs demonstrated. A 

 highlight of the day was a live animal demonstration by special 

 guests from the Boston Museum of Science. Portions of Museum 

 Education Day were filmed by wtop-tv and shown on "Eye- 

 witness News." 



Teachers are reached also by a summer workshop program, now 

 in its third year, which drew 34 participants from Montgomery 

 County and the District of Columbia in 1973. The workshops 

 enable teachers to develop curriculum units to be used in conjunc- 

 tion with museum visits. One manifestation of the workshops is 

 presently in evidence in a Montgomery County fourth-grade class- 

 room, where students have created an exhibit of American Indian 

 crafts and are learning traditional methods of pottery-making and 

 weaving in connection with visits to the National Museum of 

 Natural History. Altogether, an estimated 1500 students have been 

 engaged in art, history, and science projects during the 1973-1974 

 school year as a result of the summer workshops. 



In 1973-1974, the energy crisis brought a disappointing 26 per- 

 cent decrease in the number of school tours scheduled by this 

 office for the Mall museums. The decline was represented by 2187 

 tours given to 50,865 children. Nonetheless, classes came from as 

 far away as Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and Athens, Georgia, for the 

 National Museum of Natural History's Early Man tour; and the 

 number of outreach programs given in area classrooms jumped an 

 encouraging 18 percent, serving a total of 9,438 children through 

 357 presentations. 



An expanding force of volunteer docents, now numbering 326, 

 has been recruited and trained by oese. To augment their regular 

 training, the docents were able to attend two seminar lecture series 

 in 1973 — one in American studies and the other in the natural 

 sciences. Good indicators of the success of the docents in inspiring 

 young visitors to think about the exhibits and draw conclusions 

 from what they see are the comments the students make in the 

 course of their guided tours. The following are a few of the 

 comments recently overheard on a Colonial Life tour in the 

 Museum of History and Technology : 



226 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




Fourth-grade boy: "Suppose you couldn't learn how to do all 

 those things that needed to be done. What would have happened 

 to you?" 



Third-grade girl: "There's one reason I'd sooner have lived back 

 in those days than now, and that's because back in those days you 

 could be proud of what you did." 



Fourth-grade girl : "When so much is up to you, I guess you sort 

 of want to work hard at it because it makes you feel good to do it 

 well." 



For the past 4 years, a learning /service experience for teenager 

 volunteers has been provided through oese's summer "Info" pro- 

 gram. In June, July, and August of 1973, more than 100 high 

 school students, selected and trained by oese, conducted visitors 

 through the Mall museums. 



Several new programs are now in the planning stages. An 

 audiovisual presentation orienting teachers to Smithsonian educa- 

 tion service is being considered, as are continuing teacher work- 

 shops beginning with the 1974-1975 school year. Through work- 

 shops, publications, and related activities the Office of Elementary 

 and Secondary Education will continue to serve the Smithsonian's 

 education offices and Washington area schools. 



Office of Public Affairs 



In this technological age Americans receive more and more of their 

 information and education from various forms of the electronic 

 media. This fact alone poses new challenges to the museum 

 community as well as to a diverse academic institution such as the 

 Smithsonian, which has a charter to disseminate, as well as to 

 increase, knowledge among mankind. 



Audio and film recordings are the staples of the electronic 

 media, but they require time, energy, imagination, skill, and heavy 

 budgetary commitments to produce in a professional and meaning- 

 ful manner. Yet, in the years to come, they will be as significant 

 and lasting, perhaps, in the Smithsonian's archives as many editions 

 of the printed word. 



Public Service I 1T7 




An upcoming series of major prime-time television specials, 

 based upon the activities of the Smithsonian Institution, thrust a 

 significant new role on the Office of Public Affairs in fiscal 1974. 

 The Office became the coordinator of an allied effort of scientists, 

 administrators, historians, and other Smithsonian professionals 

 and the writers, producers, and other creative talents of the 

 David L. Wolper organization. The goal of this joint effort is to 

 bring home the richness and variety of the Institution's knowledge 

 to millions of Americans who might not otherwise have had an 

 opportunity to become aware of the Smithsonian's interests. 



In addition to preparations for this 1974-1975 Smithsonian 

 series, to be broadcast on the cbs television network as a presenta- 

 tion of the DuPont Cavalcade of television, the growth of the 

 Smithsonian during the year placed other new demands on the 

 Office of Public Affairs to provide a wide range of public informa- 

 tion activities. The Office was heavily involved in preparations for 

 the expanded Festival of American Folklife on the Mall, the new 

 product development program, the planned opening of the Hirsh- 

 horn Museum and Sculpture Garden in the fall of 1974, and the 

 Bicentennial, as well as in providing services to the ongoing 

 Smithsonian programs of research, collections, and exhibits. 



A telecommunications coordinator was selected from more than 

 300 applicants to oversee preparations for the Smithsonian's new 

 television series and the Institution's other public efforts in the 

 audiovisual media. The telecommunications staff of the Office of 

 Public Affairs cooperated with numerous television, film, and radio 

 producers planning programs based on Smithsonian activities, in 

 addition to working with a producer who expects to air three 

 significant television specials on the Smithsonian during the 1974- 

 1975 season. Several documentary films on various aspects of the 

 Smithsonian were also developed. "Radio Smithsonian" continued 

 to produce a weekly half-hour radio program which during the 

 past year was carried by some 95 radio stations Nationwide. 



During the past year the News Bureau of the Office of Public 

 Affairs wrote and distributed 311 news releases and responded to 

 hundreds of requests from the wire services, newspapers, maga- 

 zines, and the public for information on Smithsonian activities. A 

 sampler of press clippings reflecting representative press interest

The Old Patent Office Building was commemorated as a National Historic Landmark in 

 a ceremony held April 3, 1974, in the courtyard of that building, which houses the 

 National Collection of Fine Arts and the National Portrait Gallery. Shown affixing the 

 plaque are Harry Jordan, Assistant to the Director of NCFA; Mrs. Richard Nixon; and 

 Secretary Ripley. Others present for the ceremony included, from left, Meredith 

 Johnson, Office of Public Affairs; Mrs. David E. Finley; Ronald Walker, Director of the 

 National Park Service; David E. Finley, Commissioner of NCFA and NPG; Charles 

 Blitzer, Assistant Secretary for History and Art; Joshua Taylor, Director of NCFA; 

 Mrs. Ripley; and Marvin Sadik, Director of NPG. 




in the Smithsonian was initiated. Some 2.5 milUon building guides 

 and brochures were also produced by the Office. 



The Office continued to produce the Smithsonian Torch, a news- 

 paper for the Institution's employees, the widely circulated monthly 

 Smithsonian Calendar of Events, and the quarterly Smithsonian Re- 

 search Reports which has been requested by the scientific communi- 

 ties of a number of other nations. The publication. Increase and 

 Diffusion, was revised and brought up to date. 



Current information on daily events and exhibits was provided 

 by the recorded telephone service Dial-a-Museum. From informa- 

 tion furnished by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, 

 Dial-a-Phenomenon service provided information enabling callers 

 to locate and observe artificial satellites as well as to identify 

 celestial bodies. 



The Special Events staff assisted in the planning, preparation, and 

 coordination of approximately 600 events during fiscal 1974, 

 including lectures, conferences, symposia, openings of exhibitions, 

 press previews, concerts, luncheons, dinners, and receptions. 



The staff participated in arrangements for tours for the new wife 

 of the Secretary of State; the wives of visiting Latin American 

 foreign ministers; the Empress of Iran and her three children; Prime 

 Minister Tanaka of Japan; and, during the Festival of American 

 Folklife, the Secretary of Labor, President of the afl-cio, and the 

 mainland China mission to Washington. 



Other events in which the staff participated were Mrs. Nixon's 

 installation of the Department of the Interior's historic site plaque 

 at the National Collection of Fine Arts National Portrait Gallery 

 building's courtyard. Speaker Carl Albert's presentation of a portrait 

 of himself, and Mrs. Johnson's presentation of a bust of President 

 Johnson. 



The Special Events staff was also responsible for arrangements 

 when a group of Congressional wives honored Mrs. Gerald Ford 

 in the Commons, with an evening of entertainment by the British 

 Players. The Secretaries of Commerce and Treasury and the Direc- 

 tor of the Environmental Protection Agency hosted parties and 

 tours for several Soviet Union delegations; and the Secretary held 

 the biennial Diplomatic Dinner at the Renwick Gallery for the heads 

 of 18 foreign missions and a Fourth of July party for other diplo- 

 mats on the terrace of the Museum of History and Technology to 

 watch the Monument fireworks.

Office of Smithsonian Symposia and Seminars 



Improving public understanding of the work of academic special- 

 ists continued to serve as the goal of educational experiments of 

 the Office of Seminars in 1974. Its privately supported programs 

 reflect the spirit of the classic series Smithsonian Contributions 

 to Knowledge, initiated by Secretary Joseph Henry in 1847. 

 ("Knowledge should not be viewed as existing in isolated parts 

 but as a whole, each portion of which throws light on all the 

 other . . .") Mainly, the office prepares for publication — and other- 

 wise helps disseminate, through seminars, symposia, television, and 

 radio — the fruits of scholarly investigations and insights about 

 the ideas, customs, skills, and art of various cultures and civiliza- 

 tions. It calls upon the Smithsonian's own talents and combines 

 these with resources of other museums, the government, corpora- 

 tions, foundations, universities, research institutions, and profes- 

 sional societies. 



The Cultural Drama, for example, was published in 1974. An 

 illustrated collection of essays on modern identities and social fer- 

 ment, the volume features an introduction by Secretary S. Dillon 

 Ripley and a prologue calling for use of the American Bicentennial 

 observance to celebrate cultural diversity and find a new national 

 metaphor to replace "the melting pot." The Charles F. Kettering 

 Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund provided support 

 for the 1970 symposium out of which the book developed. 



Also linked to the Bicentennial are plans started in 1974 for a 

 symposium, "Kin and Communities: The Peopling of America," 

 scheduled for May 1976 as a scholarly prelude to the Smithsonian 

 Institution National Park Service Festival of American Folklife. 

 The symposium is being organized in liaison with other units of 

 the Smithsonian and in cooperation with the Department of His- 

 tory, American University, among other external organizations. 

 Consultants include Dr. Robert Coles, psychiatrist. Harvard Uni- 

 versity; Eli Evans, author of The Provincials; Dr. Albert Gollin, 

 Bureau of Social Science Research, Inc.; Dr. David Goslin, sociolo- 

 gist. National Academy of Sciences; Dr. Margaret Mead, American 

 Museum of Natural History ;"and Allon Schoener, author of Portal to 

 America: The Lower East Side, 1870-1925.

 mental Renewal (left) and Lee Talbot, Senior Scientist, Council on Environmental 

 Quality, listen.

 Communications, Maxwell Air Force Base (center), who coordinates tribal participation 

 in Air Force survival training programs. 




Secretary Ripley's suggestion that the Smithsonian sponsor a 

 Museum of the Family of Man to complete a chain of museums 

 or exhibition centers on the Mall prompted a cooperative educa- 

 tional project involving the Smithsonian and the College of Archi- 

 tecture, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacks- 

 burg, Virginia. Seminars and interviews were organized for faculty 

 and students to improve their knowledge of the workings of mu- 

 seums as preparation for their conceptualizing and designing a 

 museum of mankind as a classroom exercise. Students' reports, 

 sketches, construction models, videotapes, and other materials will 

 be given to the Smithsonian. 



"Voluntarism and the Public Interest in American Society," an 

 invitational seminar series, continued into 1974 with future pro- 

 grams being planned in cooperation with the National Commis- 

 sion on Private Philanthropy and Public Needs headed by John 

 Filer, chairman, Aetna Life and Casualty Company. Sponsored 

 jointly with the Office of Development, the series spanned two 

 years of twelve programs involving foundation officers, tax lawyers, 

 government officials, scholars, and leaders of voluntary associa- 

 tions. The Non-Profit Report, Museum News, and Foundation News 

 have published reports of the series. David L. Sills, editor of the 

 International Encyclopedia of Social Sciences, serves as editorial 

 consultant in planning an eventual volume of the papers and dis- 

 cussions. Speakers in 1974 included Margaret Mead leading a 

 discussion on "New Initiatives in Environmental Renewal," Barry 

 Commoner speaking on "The Scientist's Responsibility Toward 

 a Society in Crisis," and participants in an all-day workshop on 

 "What Can Be Done About the African Drought?" 



"Innovation in Technology" is the theme of a two-part video 

 taped seminar produced in 1974 by the Office of Seminars in co- 

 operation with the National Academy of Engineering and the 

 Exxon Corporation. Intended to stimulate classroom discussions 

 in schools of management and engineering, as well as those in the 

 humanities, the taped program included materials from engineers' 

 presentations during the Copernicus symposium and subsequent 

 commentaries by such interpreters of technology as Stephen 

 Schwartz, Claire Nader, Don Walsh, Frank Piasecki, Robert 

 Multhauf, and T. Dixon Long. 



234 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




The office also continued to work closely with seminar and 

 symposium planning of the Woodrow Wilson International Center 

 for Scholars, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and 

 the National Air and Space Museum. 



The celebration of the quincentennial of the birth of Nicolaus 

 Copernicus continued with the Office of Seminars assisting Pro- 

 fessor Owen Gingerich in his editing of the forthcoming Smith- 

 sonian Press book The Nature of Scientific Discovery, based on the 

 1973 symposium; laying the groundwork in Warsaw for an even- 

 tual Polish-language edition to be published in cooperation with 

 the Polish Academy of Sciences; cosponsoring with the Smith- 

 sonian's Division of Performing Arts a presentation at the Institu- 

 tion of Jerzy Grotowski, Poland's avant-garde actor-director; and 

 distributing to science attaches in American embassies copies of 

 the prize-winning Leonard Baskin Copernicus poster designed by 

 Stephen Kraft. The London periodical Encounter and The Bulletin 

 of Atomic Scientists have published essays contributed to the 

 Gingerich volume by Werner Heisenberg and Gerald Holton. The 

 Folger Shakespeare Library, in planning its 1974 Petrarch cele- 

 bration, drew upon the Smithsonian's experience with Copernicus, 

 and the office continued to work closely with the Copernicus So- 

 ciety of America in responding to numerous inquiries of scholarly 

 and ethnic communities seeking information on Copernicus and 

 Renaissance culture. Moreover, the office helped to facilitate new 

 showings of Jacob Bronowski's BBC-Time-Life documentary film 

 series The Ascent of Man, originally premiered in Washington 

 during the Smithsonian-National Academy of Sciences observance 

 of Copernicus Week. 



Reading Is Fundamental, Inc. 



A new year and a new president began concurrently as Dr. Sidney 

 Nelson assumed the presidency of Reading Is Fundamental, Inc., in 

 August 1973. 



By May 1, 1974, the number of active Reading Is Fundamental 

 (rif) programs (162) and developing programs (68) totaled 230. 

 At the same time in 1973, this total was 139, of which 111 were 

 active programs. These programs are all voluntary regional efforts 



Public Service I 235 




which call on rif Headquarters for program guidance, but depend 

 on their own resources for staffing funds. As a result of endorse- 

 ment by their national organizations, American Association of 

 University Women (aauw) chapters now sponsor 24 local pro- 

 grams, and the Jaycees, 8. Without such a national imprimatur, local 

 Junior Leagues sponsor 9 rif programs — a marked increase over 

 last year. Junior Women's Clubs sponsor 11 local rif programs. 



During fiscal 1974, a growing number of interracial and black 

 service organizations took local rif programs as their principal 

 cause. These include the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority; Jack & Jill, 

 Inc.; Negro Business and Professional Women; National Council of 

 Negro Women; links; the Urban League and Urban League Guilds. 



Endorsement from the Office of Education has led to the support 

 of 50 local programs — 25 under Title I and 25 Right-to-Read pro- 

 grams. The largest single program supported by federal funds 

 (Emergency School Assistance Act) was the Brooklyn, New York, 

 program involving 50,000 children in 100 schools in kindergarten 

 through the third grade. Over 10,000 requests for rif's services 

 were received from throughout the United States as a result of an 

 article which appeared in the February 1974 Reader's Digest, en- 

 titled "A Reading Program That Works." 



Major activities of rif's central office involved the preparation 

 of a RIF handbook on starting and conducting a local rif program 

 in the field, a national workshop which brought together 56 project 

 directors and staff from 15 states to share experiences and ideas, 

 a broad gauge assessment of the number and character of local rif 

 programs, public education through a national public service adver- 

 tising campaign, and the publication and distribution of a newsletter. 



The major source of rif's current support, a three year grant of 

 $1,150,000 from the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, will termi- 

 nate in 1975. With this in view, the Board of Directors under the 

 able leadership of Mrs. Robert S. McNamara, initiated a four-year 

 campaign to solicit funds from foundations, corporations, and 

 interested individuals. 



The Carnegie Corporation of New York agreed to fund a national 

 evaluation of the impact of the Reading Is Fundamental program. 

 The sum of $106,655 was appropriated to the Graduate School and 

 University Center of the City University of New York for this 

 purpose.

A new expanded rif program for the Capital was launched under 

 the leadership of Mrs. Elliott L. Richardson and Mrs. Joseph J.

 ing the next three years have been provided by the Morris and 

 Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, the Eugene and Agnes E, Meyer 

 Foundation, the National Home Library Foundation, and the Hattie 

 M. Strong Foundation. 



Smithsonian Magazine 



It has been the aim of the magazine, Smithsonian, over the past 

 4 fiscal years to provide a publication — as a benefit for National 

 and Resident members of Smithsonian Associates — which would 

 be attractive to readers with a high educational level and to adver- 

 tisers who deal in quality products. Everything seemed to come 

 together in fiscal 1974. 



When the magazine reached 600,000 net paid circulation, it 

 found itself in an eminent position among the traditional "class" 

 magazines, double the circulation of American Heritage, Natural 

 History, Harper's, and Atlantic Monthly, and larger than Scientific 

 American and the New Yorker. 



During the year, the magazine was recognized as an important 

 national publication by two major newsweeklies. Time and News- 

 week, which took note of the magazine's success and heralded it for 

 its editorial excellence. Most critics, in print and by word of mouth, 

 praised the magazine for its variety, its writing, and the beauty of 

 its illustrations. 



Smithsonian's circulation increased 33 percent and its advertising 

 revenue 85 percent in fiscal 1974 despite a softening of the econ- 

 omy. The magazine has carried a rich and varied selection of 

 advertisements from major companies in the United States, as 

 well as numerous travel and consumer goods offerings. A random 

 sampling from one issue, for example, shows, among others, adver- 

 tisements from Kodak, General Electric, General Motors, Bergstrom 

 Paper, Hueblein, General Telephone and Electronics, Alcoa, Na- 

 tional Distillers, Atlantic Richfield, Smith-Corona, Western Electric, 

 Guerlain, Bethlehem Steel, Exxon, DeBeers, and Franklin Mint. 



Public Service I 239

The editorial content itself dealt with the subjects of previous 

 years: stronger and stronger articles on conservation and energy; 

 treatments of museum spectaculars around the world in-depth — 

 for example, the tapestry treasures at the Metropolitan and the 

 beauty of Chinese art at the Musee du Petit Palais; stimulating 

 articles on natural and hard sciences such as the mystery of the 

 "black holes" in space, articles on Smithsonian gems and model 

 planes, Japanese traditions, and the ivory-billed woodpecker. . , . 



The magazine also continued to give candid and intimate views 

 of history, especially American history. The series "America Two 

 Hundred Years Ago," a month-by-month narrative of the events 

 preceding the American Revolution, became a nationwide favorite. 



In Smithsonian Year 1969 it was predicted that the magazine 

 would pay its way in the third year of publication. The prophecy 

 was correct — so accurate that in 1974 the magazine will make a 

 significant contribution to the general operating funds of the 

 private sector of the Institution. 



At any given time it is, of course, impractical to predict future 

 degrees of inflation and possible recessions, which will have to be 

 faced. Certainly, production costs have been going up. However, 

 one can predict confidently that, both with regard to the Institution 

 and to the areas in which the Institution is interested, the editorial 

 challenges will be met and the quality will continue to improve. 

 And it is the policy of Smithsonian's management, both editorially 

 and in the business areas, to remain flexible and resourceful. 



Smithsonian Associates 



The Smithsonian Associates experienced an extraordinary growth 

 this year in membership numbers and in program activities. Na- 

 tional membership increased from 450,000 to 600,000. Resident 

 membership grew from 15,000 at the end of fiscal year 1973 to 

 22,000 at the end of fiscal year 1974, representing 44,000 individ- 

 uals in the Washington metropolitan area. 



Heightened interest in Associate membership can be attributed 

 to a number of factors, not the least of which is greater program 

 visibility through the Smithsonian (magazine), the monthly As-

sociate newsletter, the Smithsonian Calendar of Events, and con- 

 tinuous media coverage. 



The pubhcation of an all-purpose brochure describing the Na- 

 tional and the Resident Associate programs has proved to be a 

 useful tool to clarify the opportunities of each type of membership. 



Cultural and educational programs of the Resident program 

 include four semesters of classes a year, family events, symposia on 

 provocative subjects, films, lectures, field trips, behind-the-scenes 

 tours, and activities for young people. This year emphasis has 

 switched from a few lecture classes in the arts, sciences, and hu- 

 manities, with a multitude of crafts classes, to a balanced class pro- 

 gram of over 65 classes per semester, with an average of 22 lecture 

 classes for adults taught by Smithsonian and visiting scholars, studio 

 classes, and children's classes. Average enrollment for these classes 

 was 2300 per semester. 



Children's activities and classes have expanded and participation 

 has been stressed. The scholarship program that enables inner-city 

 children to attend Young Associate classes reached a new high of 

 307 enrollees. This project was begun and funded by the Women's 

 Committee of the Associates. Implementation of a "Family Events" 

 page in the monthly newsletter expresses concern for and interest 

 in family activities. 



The number of day tours and overnight tours quadrupled. 

 Special events increased from 45 to 86. Free events rose from 30 to 

 43 with attendance of 23,500. 



Cooperation with divisions and bureaus within the Institution, 

 and other cultural, educational, and civic organizations increased. 

 For the first time the Resident Associate program conducted a 

 Membership Workshop, attended by representatives of 23 museums 

 from all over the country. Two programs received support from the 

 National Endowment for the Arts. The scope of the film series 

 and festivals increased. Four major film series and two festivals of 

 prize-winning noncommercial films were held. Poetry readings by 

 distinguished poets were added to the long Hst of program activities 

 and many distinguished guests from outside the family of Smithso- 

 nian scholars and performers who gave lectures or led discussions. 



The Resident program contributed over $27,000 to the unre- 

 stricted private funds of the Institution without increasing dues 

 or the prices of events. Especially popular this year were the Giants 



Public Service I 243 




of Contemporary Architecture class in which architects and archi- 

 tectural historians discussed outstanding masterpieces; Yehudi 

 Menuhin's lecture on "Creativity" where Associates sat spellbound; 

 Judith Crist's films of the seventies; Don a Hardhat, a tour of the 

 Washington Metro subway system now under construction; and 

 Shroeder loves Beethoven, a special Christmas party for Young 

 Associates. 



More than 750 Associates participated in 20 Domestic and 

 Foreign Study Tours to such places as Georgia to study the culture 

 of Indian moundbuilders; to Big Cypress Swamp in the Florida 

 Everglades to study flora and fauna; and to Ethiopia and Kenya to 

 study ancient and contemporary cultures. One particularly success- 

 ful and exciting trip was a cruise to the lagoons and coast of Baja 

 California in search of whales, sea elephants, and sea lions. 



The Contributing membership, for individuals who donate $50 

 or more annually, grew from 200 to 380 contributors. Added 

 benefits for contributing members included a selection of exhibition 

 catalogues and a reception to meet Brooke Hindle, new director of 

 the National Museum of History and Technology. 



At Christmas, the Women's Committee of the Smithsonian 

 Associates sponsored their third successful Christmas Dance. The 

 dance was staged around the African bush elephant in the National 

 Museum of Natural History. Proceeds were given to the Insect Zoo, 

 an exhibition of live insects, which the Committee has supported 

 for 3 years, and to the scholarship fund of the Resident program. A 

 larger portion of this year's proceeds will establish an experimental 

 exhibit for handicapped visitors to the National Museum of Natural . 

 History. 



The National Board of the Smithsonian Associates, a group 

 composed of 26 industrial and citizen leaders, met in October 19731 

 and adopted a set of bylaws. The Board was largely responsible for; 

 stimulating corporate support to the Institution in excess of: 

 $100,000 for fiscal year 1974. I 



One of the greatest services to the Institution is performed byj 

 the Associates Reception Center. Serving as the central visitor 

 information office for Associates and for the public, the Center has! 

 greatly strengthened its ability to respond to increasing demands 

 for informational assistance. Over 13,000 pieces of mail requesting

everything from general information for visiting purposes to 

 specific technical data were answered; 125,000 phone inquiries 

 representing a 100-percent increase in traffic over the previous 

 12-month period were also channeled through the Center. Over 

 5000 Associate families from across the country registered in the 

 Center's guest book — a figure which reflects only one-third of all 

 the Associates actually seeking the Center's assistance. 



Ninety additional information volunteers were recruited, trained, 

 and scheduled by the Center, enabling double coverage at several 

 information desks and the assumption of the additional responsi- 

 bility of maintaining an information desk at the Renwick Gallery. 

 The significance of voluntarism as an important Smithsonian re- 

 source was more widely recognized this year through an Institution- 

 wide survey conducted by the Center. The survey found that 1120 

 volunteers contributed 105,000 hours of service, an equivalent of 77 

 man-years of labor worth $914,000. 



For the National membership, a comprehensive Guide to the 

 Nation's Capital and the Smithsonian Institution was produced in 

 cooperation with Smithsonian and appeared in the April issue as 

 the magazine's first supplement. 



Smithsonian Institution Press 



I As the official publications arm of the Smithsonian, the Smith- 

 sonian Institution Press is responsible for the editing, design, pro- 

 duction, and distribution of more than oae hundred scholarly 

 monographs, scientific reports, definitive art catalogues, and infor- 

 mational brochures each year. Although, in most cases, the Press 

 staff does not do the actual writing, it does professionally assist its 

 authors in all the necessary steps in editorial and design consulta- 

 tion while the manuscript is in preparation, in review of the final 

 draft (including all illustrative material), in substantive editing, 

 copy preparation for the printer, design, layout, paste-up, produc- 

 tion supervision, and in delivery of the finished product to the 

 author and to thousands of libraries, scholars, and members of an 

 interested audience here in Washington and throughout the world. 



The Press staff has taken satisfaction from its behind-the-scenes 

 share in the laudatory reviews which have appeared in respected 



Public Service I 2^7 




journals, together with praise from the academic community, for 

 Smithsonian pubhcations issued during the year — notable among 

 which were Continental Drift, by Ursula Marvin of the Smithsonian 

 Astrophysical Observatory, and The Papers of Joseph Henry, 

 edited by Nathan Reingold. 



There are times, too, when honors redound more directly to the 

 work of the Press staff. This has been such a year. At the eleventh 

 annual blue pencil awards presentation of the Federal Editors 

 Association the Smithsonian Institution Press won 6 editorial 

 awards — more than any agency or department of the United 

 States Government. The awards were presented to Louise Heskett 

 for the Black Presence in the Era of the American Revolution 

 1770-1800 by Sidney Kaplan (National Portrait Gallery); Nancy L. 

 Powars for Windows in the Sea by Marion Clayton Link (Fort 

 Pierce Bureau); Joan B. Horn for Report of the Mohawk-Hudson 

 Area Survey edited by Robert M. Vogel (National Museum of 

 History and Technology); Louise Heskett for Air Traffic Control: 

 The Uncrowded Sky by Glen A. Gilbert (National Air and Space 

 Museum); Ernest E. Biebighauser for Continental Drift: The Evolu- 

 tion of a Concept by Ursula B. Marvin (Smithsonian Astrophysical 

 Observatory); and to John S. Lea for Form and Tire: Natzler Ceram- 

 ics 1939-1972 by Otto Natzler (National Collection of Fine Arts- 

 Renwick Gallery). 



Louise Heskett was the recipient of the first Editor-of-the-Year 

 award made by the Federal Editors Association. 



Careful editing must be wedded to good design before a manu- 

 script can be sent to the printer, and the Press' dedicated design 

 staff has also been honored during the year. In the 1974 annual 

 exhibit of the Art Directors Club of Metropolitan Washington, 

 which embraces both governmental and commercial graphic design, 

 Stephen J. Kraft was awarded the Gold Medal for Steinberg at the 

 Smithsonian (National Collection of Fine Arts), and also received 

 Awards of Merit for President Monroe's Message (National Portrait 

 Gallery) and Nicholas Copernicus (Office of Seminars). Shaker 

 (National Collection of Fine Arts-Renwick Gallery), designed by 

 Crimilda Pontes, has been chosen by the Association of American 

 University Presses for excellence of design and production. It will be 

 on display at major universities throughout this country and, under ' 



248 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




the sponsorship of the United States Information Agency, in 26 

 countries abroad. 



The Press' major effort in fiscal 1974 has been in marketing and 

 distribution, where exciting new programs for reaching a much 

 broader audience for Smithsonian pubhcations — both Federal and 

 private — have been developed. Cooperating in these efforts are the 

 American Library Association, Xerox University Microfilm, Micro- 

 filming Corporation of America, the Superintendent of Documents, 

 and some of the country's leading bookstore chains. 



During the year, production costs of 124 publications were 

 funded by Federal appropriations in the amount of $358,000; 

 7 trade publications were supported wholly by Smithsonian private 

 funds in the amount of $105,700. The Press and the Superintendent 

 of Documents shipped, on order and subscriptions, a total of 

 157,410 publications and 386 records. In addition, 1,506,972 art 

 catalogues, brochures, leaflets, and miscellaneous items were 

 distributed. 



A full list of Smithsonian Institution Press publications for fiscal 

 year 1974 may be found in Appendix 7.

Smithsonian Year * 1974 



ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT 



The smooth operation of a vast institution such as the Smithsonian 

 depends in large measure on its administrative management. The 

 IjSmithsonian Institution — so viable in the civilizing process — must 

 rlhave a firm basic administrative structure that is far-seeing yet effi- 

 cient and reliable, if it is to fulfill its well-known mandate not only 

 to disseminate knowledge but to increase knowledge. The reports 

 which follow concerning the Smithsonian's Support Activities, 

 Financial Services, Office of Audits, and International Exchange 

 Service recount an impressive array of activities in fiscal year 1974. 



Support Activities 



To augment his immediate staff of one Administrative Officer, the 

 Director of Support Activities filled two other positions during the 

 /ear, a Special Assistant for programming and budgeting activities, 

 and a Programs Manager for special projects such as Smithsonian- 

 wide programs in energy conservation, environmental protection, 

 and employee/visitor parking. 



The Smithsonian's justification in the fiscal year 1975 budget 

 request for additional support resources was well received. This im- 

 portant recognition stems from the program and priorities approach 

 developed during the conference at Belmont in February of last 

 year. Support activities across the Institution are moving forward 

 in terms of obtaining more resources as well as in terms of rede- 

 fining responsibilities of bureau directors for various support serv- 

 ices provided in their respective buildings. Though this is encourag- 

 ing, it is realized that the Institution still has some distamce to go in 



251 




achieving its objective to provide quality support for all programs. 



Many plans for Bicentennial requirements were completed during 

 the year, and support was given to some programs already under 

 way. Essential additional resources will be sought in the next 

 budget cycle, the last opportunity to obtain adequate logistical 

 support to carry through the Bicentennial programs. 



Brief summaries of the major activities of the organizations in 

 the central support group are given below. 



INFORMATION SYSTEMS DIVISION 



Information Systems Division develops and coordinates the use of 

 automatic data processing support throughout the Institution. 

 Advances continued to be made through computer utilization in the 

 areas of administration, management of the national collections, 

 and scientific research. Research was conducted in optical character 

 recognition for entering data directly from a printed page, terminal 

 devices to enable telephone communication with the computer, and 

 computer output to microfilm and microfiche, as well as plotted 

 maps and other graphic presentations. 



Individual research assistance to curators and scientists expanded 

 and broadened in scope as the Division made available additional 

 mathematical techniques and software packages. New develop- 

 ments and refinements enhanced support for the management of 

 the national collections in history, art, and science. A recently 

 developed, but not yet completed, generalized information man- 

 agement package called selgem has aroused much attention within 

 and outside the Institution because of its potential as a standard for 

 the computerized management of collections. The Division pub- 

 lishes information about the selgem system in its technical bulletin, 

 Smithsonian Institution Information Systems Innovations. The "In- 

 novations" series acquaints the reader with automated systems and 

 procedures specifically designed to solve collection and research 

 problems in museums and herbaria. 



MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS OFFICE 



The three major responsibilities of the Management Analysis Office 

 (mao) are: providing management advisory and analysis services; 

 making comprehensive reviews of proposed management issuances 



252 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




and coordinating their publication; and administering a forms man- 

 agement program. 



In the first three quarters of the year, over 75 individual staff 

 analyses and studies were completed, the majority of which cul- 

 minated in management issuances covering new or revised policies 

 and procedures on a variety of subjects. 



In this same period, the Forms Management Section provided 

 service to over 84 units of the Smithsonian. Unavoidable delays 

 occurred in the implementation of the adp program developed to 

 support the management and control of Smithsonian forms. It is 

 hoped that this program will be in successful operation by the third 

 quarter of the forthcoming fiscal year. 



In March, mao acquired Videotype (word processing) equipment 

 with which Smithsonian's management issuances and other admin- 

 istrative documents can be prepared more efficiently and faster. 

 This new technological development in the field of automatic typ- 

 ing can enhance not only mao's productivity but also that of the 

 Institution as a whole. 



OFFICE OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 



Progress in the Smithsonian Institution's Equal Employment Op- 

 portunity Program continued. Compliance with the complaints pro- 

 gram was outstanding as complaints were processed without delay. 

 The precomplaint counseling program, established in late 1972, 

 functioned effectively. Of the more than 150 employees counseled, 

 9 formal complaints were filed and 8 were investigated. Of these 8, 

 2 were adjusted satisfactorily. Only 1 complaint proceeded to a 

 hearing. The number of employees counseled, compared with those 

 who filed formal complaints, demonstrates graphically the value of 

 the complaints system. 



A Sixteen-Point Program Coordinator was appointed and trained, 

 and Upward Mobility Programs were implemented in the National 

 Museum of Natural History and the Office of Plant Services. 



The first member of a minority in a supergrade was appointed 

 Assistant Secretary for Public Service and member of the Secre- 

 tary's Executive Committee. 



The Office of Personnel Administration's training course, "The 

 Supervisor's Role in eeo," established last year, continued. Over 



Administrative Management I 253 




105 on-board and new supervisors have received this training, and 

 others will be scheduled to attend the monthly sessions. Eventually 

 all Smithsonian supervisors will take this course. 



The Women's Program evolved successfully. Bylaws were ap 

 proved for the Women's Council; Council membership increased: 

 from 9 to 15; and Smithsonian's Women's Week, held for the first 

 time in October 1973, will be an annual event. 



OFFICE OF FACILITIES PLANNING AND 

 ENGINEERING SERVICES 



The 1973 Priorities Conference at Belmont set forth the "need fori 

 support activities to be organized and motivated to provide the bestt 

 delivery of services to the program units and their managers." Ini 

 addition, the conference discussions focused on the "creation off 

 better Institutional and bureau administrative awareness to accom- 

 modate anticipated future growth as a requirement." Thus, based 

 upon the theme of the conference and succeeding executive deter-- 

 minations, the Office of Facilities Planning and Engineering Services 

 (oFPEs) was estabUshed on October 26, 1973. 



OFPES serves the Smithsonian by providing professional advice 

 and counsel to the Secretary, Executive Committee, and Bureau 

 Directors on matters pertaining to new construction and develop-, 

 ment of the physical plant. Operational services furnished by ofpes 

 include: (1) facilities planning and architectural review, (2) engineer- 

 ing and design development, and (3) construction contract manage- 

 ment and cost evaluation. Projects planned, developed, and man- 

 aged by OFPES are accomplished primarily through the contract and 

 procurement cycle, requiring extensive technical analysis and prepa- 

 ration of detailed plans, drawings, and specifications to attain maxi- 

 mum dollar return. During the year, ofpes processed, reviewed, 

 managed, or provided assistance for new construction projects for 

 the Institution totaling $65 million. In addition, projects of an alter- 

 ation, improvement, or restoration-renovation nature in the scope 

 of ofpes' activities during fiscal year 1974 entailed the expenditure 

 of $5.5 million. 



The more significant new construction projects in progress or 

 completed during the year were: the National Air and Space Mu- 

 seum, scheduled for completion in fiscal 1976; the Hirshhorn 



254 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




I 



'Museum and Sculpture Garden due to be completed early in fiscal 

 year 1975; storage and program facilities at the Silver Hill com- 

 plex; decking ranges in the Arts and Industries building to provide 

 additional square footage; and the Exhibit Design and Prodliction 

 Laboratory at the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum. Major altera- 

 tion, improvement, or restoration-renovation projects either initi- 

 ated or completed during the year were: Arts and Industries build- 

 ing restoration and central air conditioning; Center for the Study of 

 Man administrative area; renovation of the third floor and the 

 Seventh Street corridor and air conditioning for the Fine Arts and 

 Portrait Galleries; escalators for the Natural History building; and 

 numerous other projects involving various galleries, exhibit areas, 

 and special-purpose spaces for all major museums, ofpes also proc- 

 essed approximately 75 construction-oriented projects, with the 

 load projected to increase significantly during the coming years. In 

 • addition to specific projects completed during the year, ofpes con- 

 ■ tributed to the long-range project-development program, particu- 

 : larly in the development and design areas, including the Museum 

 Support Facility, Nation of Nations exhibit. Bicentennial planning, 

 : South Yard development, and the Jefferson Island bulkhead project. 



OFFICE OF PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATION 



Among the services provided by the Office of Personnel Adminis- 

 tration are manpower analysis, recruitment and placement, com- 

 pensation programs, training and career development, employee 

 relations, labor-management relations, and special responsibilities 

 in assuring equal opportunity. In addition, the Office bears respon- 

 sibility for the implementation of new laws or policy, such as the 

 Fair Labor Standards Act, Public Law 93-259. 



Each of the major program areas experienced an increase in activ- 

 ity deriving from the general growth of the Institution. Active 

 recruitment for new positions took place; a new, more formal, 

 position-classification program was begun; position-management 

 studies in the National Museum of Natural History were under- 

 taken; and a number of employee problems were resolved. Upward 

 mobility assistance to employees was provided in several of the 

 museums through plans developed in conjunction with line man- 

 agers. These plans were devised to maximize individual skills 



Administrative Management I 255 




through training, job design, and other techniques, with particular 

 emphasis on releasing employees from dead end or otherwise 

 unsatisfying jobs. | 



Other positive approaches were taken to serve both managers 

 and employees, notably those efforts extended by the task force to 

 implement the reorganization of the former Buildings Management 

 Department. Here, techniques were used which attempted to bring 

 together to the greatest extent possible the needs of the Institution 

 with the interests of individual employees. 



Labor-management relations continued to function in a healthy 

 way. Negotiations to modify an existing agreement were begun in 

 one bargaining unit, and consultations and meetings were carried 

 out in all units according to public policy and specific contracts. The 

 grievance procedure negotiated in the union contracts was utilized 

 in several instances, as both labor and management became ac- 

 customed to joint problem solving. 



Twelve top managers received extended, in-depth, executive- 

 development training. Approximately 300 supervisors received in- 

 house training in two courses, the first dealing with the dynamics 

 of interpersonal relationships and the second with the role of the 

 supervisor in equal employment opportunity. In addition, a survey 

 of supervisory skills was undertaken in order to plan for future 

 training needs. 



OFFICE OF PLANT SERVICES 



The Office of Plant Services was established in November 1973, 

 following the restructuring of the former Buildings Management 

 Department. The new office is responsible for maintenance and 

 repair of the Smithsonian physical plant; operation of utilities sys- 

 tems; maintenance of communication, transportation, mail and 

 messenger, and horticultural programs; grounds maintenance; and 

 storage of the Smithsonian collections. It also is establishing and 

 implementing standards of maintenance for the entire Institution. 

 The Crafts Services Division of the new office completed the 

 following major projects during the year: restoring the fire-dam- 

 aged Belmont Conference Center; constructing a new staff and 

 public restaurant facility in 'the Fine Arts and Portrait Galleries; 

 providing support to the Festival of American Folklife; completing 

 modernization of the photographic laboratory. Arts and Industries 



256 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




'building; remodeling the Conservation Analytical Laboratory, His- 

 tory and Technology building; and installing a complete new light- 

 ing system in Building 10, Silver Hill Facility. 



In late March, the Communications and Transportation Services 

 Division was delegated the responsibility for the Smithsonian Mail 

 and Messenger Service. Planning for the future of this major serv- 

 ice was begun in April and is expected to result in better utilization 

 of resources, more efficient use of monies, and higher level service 

 to the user. 



Plans to relocate the Automotive Equipment Repair Shop from 

 Building 1 to Building 7 at Silver Hill were completed during the 

 year. When the relocation is accomplished in late 1974, a higher 

 level of productivity is anticipated through the use of a more suit- 

 able work area. 



The Horticultural Services Division undertook a number of Bi- 

 centennial projects during 1974, including design of a Victorian 

 Garden for the South Yard, design for plantings in the Arts and 

 Industries Conservatory, a State flower and State tree project, and 

 a nursery-greenhouse operation. A National Horticultural Advisory 

 Committee of prominent horticulturists and botanical garden and 

 arboretum directors was established to assist in long-range pro- 



I gramming, planning, and evaluation of future horticultural opera- 



, tions of the Smithsonian. 



For the Warehousing Services Division, the first priority in 1974 

 was the cleanup of existing warehousing problems in Building 3, 



' Alexandria, Virginia, and at the Silver Hill Facility in Maryland. In 

 addition to assisting in office moves, the Division has been identi- 

 fying storage and service problems, and training personnel in 

 proper management of storage facilities. 



OFFICE OF PRINTING AND PHOTOGRAPHIC SERVICES 



The Office of Printing and Photographic Services was established 

 July 1, 1973, by combining the Photographic Services Division with 

 the activities and personnel of the Smithsonian Institution Print 

 Shop (Museum Branch, GPO) and the Duplicating Section. A 

 color-processing facility was installed and, by September, is ex- 

 pected to be in full operation. The adp production reporting system 

 was activated and, as in 1973, the production of photographic 

 materials increased greatly. 



Administrative Management I 257 




Again this year, the volume of photographic assignments in- 

 creased. Approximately 4000 feet of movie film were taken of 

 various Smithsonian special events and construction sites. In addi- 

 tion, millions of pieces of documentary materials remain to be 

 microfilmed. Modern lighting equipment was installed in the History 

 and Technology building studio. This improvement enhanced the 

 Branch's capability to use special lighting techniques and effects for 

 photographing accurately and artistically objects in the national 

 collections. 



A large project of 11,176 black-and-white prints was completed 

 for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, and 

 5588 new film negatives were made. New equipment was obtained 

 for the copy and printing sections. A new color section was estab- 

 lished with the purchase and installation of color equipment in the 

 Arts and Industries building laboratory which was renovated for 

 this purpose. 



To support the adp program, new forms were developed for ob- 

 taining caption data from the scientists and curators. Now 9485 

 index cards are available for retrieving information, and the most 

 popular subjects are filed and indexed by organization unit, subject 

 matter, and key words. The Library Branch worked on 6900 re- 

 quests, including retrievals, inquiries, captions, and negative num- 

 bers; 3900 feet of movie film were filed; and 980 negatives (4'' x 5'') 

 of portraits and passports of Smithsonian officials are filed for ready 

 reference. 



More than 10,000 requests received from students, educators, 

 scientists, and the general public were handled this year. In maxi- 

 mizing "the diffusion of knowledge" through the visual media, an 

 all-out effort was initiated to produce "SI Aids for Educational and 

 Cultural Enrichment." Initially, these will be in the form of slide/ 

 lectures for use in primary and secondary education. Staff members 

 throughout the Institution and the Volunteer Ladies Committee of 

 the Smithsonian Associates are participating actively in this pro- 

 gram. In conjunction with the Smithsonian Museum Shops, slides 

 in sleeves illustrating aircraft in the National Air and Space Mu- 

 seum and animals at the National Zoo were produced for sale. As 

 the slide program expands in the future, objects from other Smith- 

 sonian museums will be incloded.

 the Smithsonian's National Anthropological Archives and the Office of Academic 

 Studies. (Photograph by Vincent P. Connolly) 




OFFICE OF PROTECTION SERVICES 



The Office of Protection Services instituted daily safety and fire 

 inspection tours and monthly fire equipment inspections. Prior to 

 letting of contracts, the Health and Safety Division is reviewing 

 all contemplated construction changes to consider safety and fire 

 provisions for exits, lighting, floor surfaces, stairs, and ramps, and 

 for fire detection/suppression needs. 



The Smithsonian Institution was nominated for the President's 

 Safety Award for 1973. The Smithsonian has been nominated 7 

 times for this coveted honor and has won it twice. The Award for 

 1972 was presented this year by Secretary of Labor Brennan on 

 the President's behalf to Paul N. Perrot, Assistant Secretary for 

 Museum Programs, who accepted for Secretary Ripley and the 

 Smithsonian. This was in recognition of the reduction of Smith- 

 sonian's accident rate over a 3-year period and notably by 12 per- 

 cent in 1971-1972. On March 5, 1974, Under Secretary Robert A. 

 Brooks, in turn, presented the award to Richard L, Ault, Director 

 of Support Activities. 



During the year, 8 new exhibit halls requiring guard service were 

 opened to the public. Guards were furnished for 186 special events 

 held in various Smithsonian buildings. Among the prominent activ- 

 ities in which the guards participated were the visits of the President 

 of Pakistan and the Empress of Iran. These participations included 

 the security and escort of distinguished guests and the security 

 activities of personnel present on the occasions. 



During the year, 56 guard force personnel completed the basic 

 security course including First Aid and Weapons Qualification and 

 were commissioned as Special Policemen. 



In October 1973, a special operational element designated as the 

 Outpost Detachment was activated and given the protection respon- 

 sibility for the Renwick Gallery, Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, 

 and the facilities at Silver Hill, 24th Street, and Lamont Street. The 

 desired objective of improving security at these outlying establish- 

 ments is realized by the permanent assignment of personnel who 

 make daily supervisory inspections of every location on each relief. 

 The supervisors also are responsible for inspecting the quality of 

 security at separate locations where protection is carried out pri- 

 vately by the occupants or by contract security agencies. As addi- 



260 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




tional facilities are established that are not large enough to warrant 



activation of a new guard company, they too will be added to the 



Outpost Detachment's area of responsibility. 



All first- and second-line supervisors have completed the equal 



employment opportunity supervisory training course. During the 



year, through reassignment and/or employment, 26 women were 



accepted for employment as security guards. 



I 



SUPPLY DIVISION 



The Supply Division continued to experience increased procure- 

 ment and contracting work loads primarily due to the general ex- 

 pansion of the Smithsonian Institution and its many related activi- 

 ties, and all indications point to future accelerated growth in both 

 of these responsibilities. 



The major procurements for the new Hirshhorn Museum and 

 Sculpture Garden were accomplished during the year. Contracting 

 is well under way for the special requirements and exhibits planned 

 for the National Air and Space Museum which will open in 1976. 



The Division also assumed responsibility for all construction 

 contracted during the year, and its most significant accomplishment 

 was the contract for major renovation of the Arts and Industries 

 building which was in progress at year's end. 



The Division continued to be an active participant in the acquisi- 

 tion of useful excess Government property to satisfy the needs of 

 the Institution's many organization units. Excess property acquired 

 this year was more than $500,000. 



TRAVEL SERVICES OFFICE 



Again this year, the Travel Services Office (tso) experienced 

 growth in all its major activities; i.e., air and rail reservations 

 booked were up 40 percent; travel itineraries issued up 30 percent; 

 transportation requests prepared up 25 percent; and the cost of 

 transportation purchased from appropriated and nonappropriated 

 funds was some 40 percent higher than last year. 



In addition to furnishing travel services, advisory services and 

 detailed planning data were provided for the annual Festival of 

 American Folklife, for national and international conferences, and 

 for meetings and archeological expeditions in Yugoslavia, Israel, 

 Egypt, and Greece. 



Administrative Management I 261 






Of particular interest this year was a Travel Seminar sponsored!! 

 by the Accounting Division for administrative staff of the Smith 

 sonian. At the request of the Chief Accountant, the Chief of Tsol 

 participated in the training sessions and explained the role of her! 

 office in providing travel services for official Smithsonian travelers. 1 



During the year, a closer liaison had to be maintained with the 

 airlines to accomplish increasingly complex travel performed for 

 the Foreign Currency Program of the Office of International and 

 Environmental Programs. 



Financial Services 



■ 



The Treasurer has overall responsibility for the financial assets of I 

 the Smithsonian Institution. This includes the budgeting and ac- 

 counting of federal appropriations, the fiscal administration of 

 grants and contracts, and the monitoring of revenue-producing ; 

 activities; further detail on these activities is given in the reports- 

 which follow on the Office of Programming and Budget, the Ac- 

 counting Division, the Grants and Insurance Administration Divi- 

 sion, and the Business Management Office. 



Working closely with the Investment Policy Committee of the 

 Board of Regents, the Treasurer oversees the management of the' 

 endowment funds of the Institution by three professional advisory 

 firms, and is also responsible for the short-term investment of cur- 

 rent funds excess to immediate operating needs. Details on these 

 funds and the other financial resources of the Institution can be 

 found in the Financial Report at the front of this volume. 



OFFICE OF PROGRAMMING AND BUDGET 



The Office of Programming and Budget participates in program plan- , 

 ning for the Institution and, to carry out these plans, is responsible | 

 for the formulation, presentation, implementation, and review of 

 operating and construction budgets of appropriated and nonappro- 

 priated funds. About $100 million from many different sources were 

 involved this year. Details on these sources and their use may be 

 found in the Financial Report. The Office works in close associa- 

 tion with all operating and managerial levels of the Institution. 





262 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




During the year, the staff of seven persons engaged in the follow- 

 ing activities. Detailed fiscal 1974 operating budgets and associated 

 staffing plans for both federal and nonfederal funds were developed 

 with some 75 individual organization units and programs. These 

 ranged from the major museums and research laboratories to small 

 service and staff offices. Subsequently, throughout the year, these 

 budgets and plans were monitored and reviewed with the perform- 

 ing units to assure that program plans were accomplished within 

 approved amounts. The uncertainty at the beginning of the year as 

 to whether several legislated pay raises would be financed with sup- 

 plemental appropriations required special efforts to assure the wisest 

 application of financial resources. 



Based on the decision reached at the February 1973 Belmont Con- 

 I ference on Goals and Priorities (in which the Office was heavily 

 involved) that emphasis must be given to strengthening the support 

 1 functions of the Institution, such as collections conservation and 

 , protection of buildings, the Office developed and presented to the 

 President's Office of Management and Budget a completely revised 

 format for the fiscal year 1975 budget. As compared with the tradi- 

 tional organizational unit presentation, the new format was pro- 

 grammatic in nature designed to show clearly the base capability 

 and resource requirements of the support functions as well as the 

 equally high priority of our Bicentennial Program commitments. 

 This budget presentation was received very favorably by the Office 

 of Management and Budget and resulted in the Smithsonian being 

 allowed to seek substantial additional appropriations for these needs 

 from the Congress. The Office of Programming and Budget prepared 

 and submitted to the Congress budget justifications and supporting 

 documentation and prepared for and participated in the budget 

 hearings before the House and Senate Appropriation Committees. 

 Similar work was carried out on the fiscal year 1974 pay supple- 

 mental appropriation. 



At the same time, the Office of Programming and Budget devel- 

 oped a more formal system for planning and goal-setting by each 

 Smithsonian organization unit — now required by the expansion of 

 the Institution, by the increasingly decentralized nature of much of 

 its activity, and by the growing complexity of administering its 

 diversified organizations. 



Administrative Management I 263 




In addition to the above Institution-wide responsibilities, the 

 Office of Programming and Budget also engaged in a number of 

 special projects. It was involved intensively in the formulation and 

 management review of fiscal years 1974 and 1975 budgets for the 

 proposed Millwood Museum. It developed a comprehensive Institu- 

 tion-wide exhibition plan, schedule, and budget. An inventory of 

 Smithsonian buildings and facilities was prepared for the Board of 

 Regents. Finally, the Office played major roles in the reorganizations 

 of the Office of Exhibits and the Buildings Management Department. 



ACCOUNTING DIVISION 



The Accounting Division regularly handles and accounts for all 

 funds of the Institution, both federal and nonfederal, including pay- 

 rolls, payments for materials and services, and receipts from a great 

 variety of sources, and in addition provides over 600 financial reports 

 monthly to Institutional managers at unit and headquarters levels. 



Continuing the accounting services improvement program during 

 fiscal 1974, the Accounting Division staff initiated and, with the 

 assistance of other offices, conducted seminars on time-keeping and 

 payroll, procurement and payment procedures, travel and voucher- 

 ing procedures, and financial reporting. These seminars were at- 

 tended by 200 Smithsonian administrative personnel including 

 officers, assistants, clerks, and secretaries. With the assistance of 

 our computer specialists, the Accounting staff installed a key-to- 

 disc data entry system to replace an inefficient card and paper tape 

 system eliminating repetitious data processing and adding beneficial 

 controls. The new system became operational May 1, 1974, with full 

 implementation projected January 1, 1975. Additionally, installation 

 in fiscal year 1974 of a new personnel time reporting procedure is 

 also serving to speed and improve accuracy of payroll preparation. 



GRANTS AND INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION DIVISION 



The Grants and Insurance Administration Division is responsible 

 for administration of gifts, grants, and contracts received by the 

 Institution. In addition, this Division administers the Institution's 

 risk management and insurance program. The Division provides 

 administrative, management, and fiscal services to Smithsonian re- 

 searchers and the business representatives of granting agencies, as 



264 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




well as the controls necessary to assure that funds are expended in 

 accordance with appropriate regulations and contract terms. 



During the past year the Division has continued its excellent ad- 

 ministration in the gift, grant, and contract area and at the same 

 time has expanded its operations in the risk management and insur- 

 ance area. This expansion has entailed the initiation of risk manage- 

 ment surveys of various organizations and bureaus of the Smith- 

 sonian to identify risk and recommend ways of alleviating and 

 protecting against such risks. In addition, collections insurance cov- 

 erages throughout the Institution have been consolidated, resulting 

 in reduced work loads and the saving of considerable funds through 

 premium reductions. 



BUSINESS MANAGEMENT OFFICE 



In addition to having overall responsibility for the Museum Shops, 

 the Product Development Program and the Belmont Conference 

 Center, which are described below, the Business Management Office 

 also advises other Smithsonian bureaus on the negotiation and 

 monitoring of revenue-producing concessions and contracts. During 

 the past year, for example. Business Management assisted on such 

 diverse projects as the contracts for educational sound systems in 

 the National Museum of Natural History and the Hirshhorn Mu- 

 seum, the competitive solicitation of food service and parking con- 

 cessionaires for the new National Air and Space Museum, and the 

 construction of a new restaurant in the National Collection of Fine 

 Arts and National Portrait Gallery building. The efforts of this office 

 are an important element in the improvement of the Institution's 

 nonfederal resources. 



Museum Shops 



The past year was one of growth and change for the Museum Shops. 

 For the first time sales climbed above $2 million, and net income 

 reached the quarter-million mark. More importantly, 1974 saw the 

 laying of groundwork which will produce far greater benefits to our 

 Museums and visitors in the future. 



Recognizing that the Shops should provide a means for a visitor 

 to extend his museum experience, selection and display of merchan- 

 dise has been drastically changed to provide increased educational 

 values and a greater reflection of the museum in which a shop is 



Administrative Management I 265 




located. A leading architectural firm with extensive museum experi- 

 ence was retained to redesign completely the main shop in the 

 National Museum of History and Technology — a project scheduled 

 for completion by December 1974. 



A number of important organizational changes were also made, 

 with each shop manager being delegated responsibility for a specific 

 area. A new position of Controller was created to provide greater 

 inventory control and reports for management guidance. The Dis- 

 play Department was reorganized, and a new position was created 

 in the Buying Department. 



Product Development Program 



The Product Development Program originated from efforts to im- 

 prove the quality and relevance of items handled in the Museum 

 Shops and as a means to bring to audiences other than the 

 Smithsonian's Washington visitors the educational values of the 

 Institution. 



As a part of this program. Tonka Corporation — a leading U.S. 

 toy manufacturer with whom an agreement has been in effect since 

 1972, and under which it will manufacture and sell, in close coordi- 

 nation with Smithsonian, a line of museum-related products — in- 

 troduced in fiscal year 1974 a series of diorama kits with a Smithso- 

 nian theme. These hobby/craft products effectively enable the 

 builder to recapture a moment in history by creating an entire scene. 

 Each kit is accompanied by a 24-page booklet containing detailed 

 information on the historical period. 



Similar agreements were reached during fiscal 1974 with three 

 additional corporations. The first of these was with the Fieldcrest 

 Company, which is developing bedspreads, quilts, comforters, blan- 

 kets, sheets, and towels based on designs found in the Smithsonian 

 collection items. Its trade introduction in May was well received, 

 and products will reach the market in the fall of 1974. Another agree- 

 ment was with the Stieff Company for a line of silver and pewter 

 reproductions. The third was with the F. Schumacher Company, a 

 producer of decorative fabrics and wall coverings. 



Fiscal year 1974 also saw the introduction of Seeing the Smith- 

 sonian, the official guidebook to the Institution, in four foreign 

 languages — French, German, Japanese, and Spanish. Mr. Kenneth 

 Rush, then Deputy Secretary of State, spoke at the introductory 



266 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




ceremony. Due to the generosity of CBS/Publishing Group, the 

 publisher of the guidebook. Seeing the Smithsonian is now available 

 in braille at designated locations. 



Belmont Conference Center 



The Belmont Conference Center, located between the District of 

 Columbia and Baltimore near Interstate 95, provides an attractive, 

 secluded, gracious, and exclusive retreat unusual in the Eastern Cor- 

 ridor. Its easy access to the Baltimore-Washington airports, as well 

 as to automotive arteries, impresses upon its guests the enjoyable 

 paradox of a rural setting with the conveniences of urban proximity 

 but without its complexities. One of the major advantages of Bel- 

 mont is its use by only one group at any one time; schedules are so 

 arranged as to avoid the overlap and attendant discomforts often 

 encountered in other conference centers and hotels. Since its open- 

 ing in 1967, conference operations have been directed toward the 

 needs of small groups which require a location unencumbered by the 

 normal intrusions associated with offices. The 240-year-old manor 

 house, with 365 surrounding acres of lawns, forests, and fields, 

 provides a working retreat for the productive groups which keep 

 returning to the Center. 

 f Belmont can accommodate 24 in-house residents, with facilities 

 for 10 to 12 additional guests, speakers, or observers for meals and 

 meeting sessions. This limiting size factor ensures that each confer- 

 ence has the undivided and individual attention of the entire staff, 

 as well as the opportunity for unusually close interaction within the 

 meeting group itself. Of the 80 or so meetings which Belmont hosts 

 in a year, approximately 60 percent are from federally-funded agen- 

 cies; the balance includes those from foundations and other philcin- 

 thropic organizations, professional, religious, and social groups, 

 corporations and private industry, and universities and colleges. 



Office of Audits 



During fiscal year 1974, the Office of Audits issued audit reports on 

 the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, the Smithsonian Research 

 Foundation, the National Zoological Park, the Chesapeake Bay Cen- 

 ter for Environmental Studies, Mail Management, the Mediterranean 



Administrative Management I 267

Belmont Conference Center. 






Marine Sorting Center, the Smithsonian Institution Press, the Travel 

 Services Office, and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. 

 Audit recommendations made in these reports have resulted in im- 

 proved management procedures and controls, sometimes pointing to 

 potential dollar savings. 



In addition, the Office of Audits completed various pre-award and 

 post-audits of contracts, and closed out 26 foreign currency grants 

 in the amount of $1 million. 



International Exchange Service 



The International Exchange Service is the one program bureau in 

 the support activities group. In 1851, the Smithsonian Institution 

 established the international exchange system to provide a means 

 for exchanging current Smithsonian publications for the trans- 

 actions and proceedings of institutions in other countries. Other 

 learned bodies in the United States were allowed to participate by 

 exchanging their publications with those of foreign organizations. 

 This program has continued through the years and, by this method, 

 many colleges, universities, scientific societies, and medical and 

 dental libraries exchange their current and duplicate publications 

 with similar organizations in other countries. 



During the year, over 700,000 pounds of publications were re- 

 ceived from more than 250 organizations in the United States for 

 transmission through the Service to over 100 countries. Publica- 

 tions weighing approximately 500,000 pounds were forwarded by 

 ocean freight to 38 exchange bureaus in 32 countries. Approxi- 

 mately 250,000 pounds of publications were mailed to the intended 

 recipients in countries that do not have exchange bureaus. 



Publications weighing approximately 90,000 pounds were re- 

 ceived from exchange bureaus in other countries for distribution in 

 the United States. 



Over 700,000 official United States publications weighing ap- 

 proximately 350,000 pounds were received for 91 organizations in 

 62 countries in exchange for the official publications of those 

 countries. The daily issues of the Congressional Record and the 

 Federal Register were exchanged with 126 foreign libraries in 62 

 countries for the parliamentary journals of these countries.

Smithsonian Women's Council 



The Smithsonian Women's Council was established by the Secre- 

 tary in 1972 to represent to the Smithsonian's leadership the con- 

 cerns of women at the Institution regarding employment and related 

 matters. 



During its first full term of existence in 1973-1974, the Council 

 undertook several major projects. Its Child-care Committee acted 

 on indications from employees that employer child-care assistance 

 was of concern to them and on the evidence that Smithsonian 

 resources could make special contributions to the development 

 and education of children in general through progams conducted 

 for employees' children. Based on information from a wide variety 

 of sources, the Women's Council prepared a proposal in the fall 

 of 1973 for an experimental program, providing for hiring a spe- 

 cialist in child care and development programming. After an initial 

 assignment of designing an information-exchange service for em- 

 ployees concerned with child care, the specialist would move on 

 rapidly to the development and execution of a summer educational 

 program for school-age children and finally the presentation of 

 recommendations for the Smithsonian's future role in the care 

 and education of its employees' children. Administrative and finan- 

 cial elements were settled during the following winter and in the 

 late spring of 1974 recruiting for the position of Child-care Coor- 

 dinator began. The Assistant Secretary for Public Service assumed 

 overall responsibility for the program with assistance from an ad- 

 visory board representing the Women's Council and the Offices 

 of Museum Programs, Personnel Administration, Equal Oppor- 

 tunity, and the Treasurer. 



Another Council committee, formed to study patterns of recruit- 

 ment, employment, and promotion at the Smithsonian, analyzed 

 the Smithsonian's Merit Promotion Program and the skills-file 

 method currently in use in internal recruiting for clerical and sec- 

 retarial positions and offered recommendations for elimination of 

 inequities in these systems and improvement of their operation. 

 The report and recommendations were submitted to the Directors 

 of Personnel Administration and Equal Opportunity in April 1974. 



Other committees of the Council have been and are engaged in 

 widely varied activities. One conducted studies and analysis of the 



270 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




: Institution's Upward Mobility Program and submitted to Person- 

 nel Administration and Equal Opportunity recommendations for 

 significant changes and expansion in that area. Another committee 

 sponsored a lecture on "The Job Jungle" by career-development 

 expert Alexander Methven, which drew 170 employees and guests. 

 Yet another committee is developing plans for a rich variety of 

 programs and exhibits to mark Women's Week in August 1974.

Smithsonian Year • 1974 



NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART 



J. CARTER BROWN, DIRECTOR 



The national gallery of art, although formally established as a 

 bureau of the Smithsonian Institution, is an autonomous and sepa- 

 rately administered organization. It is governed by its own Board 

 of Trustees, the statutory members of which are the Chief Justice 

 of the United States, Chairman; the Secretary of State; the Secre- 

 tary of the Treasury; and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu- 

 tion, all ex officio; and five general trustees. Paul Mellon continued 

 as president of the Gallery and John Hay Whitney as vice president. 

 The other general trustees continuing to serve were Dr. Franklin 

 D. Murphy and Stoddard M. Stevens. In March 1974, Mr. Lessing 

 J. Rosenwald resigned after ten years as a trustee; Mr. Carlisle H. 

 Humelsine, President of Colonial Williamsburg, was elected to 

 succeed him. 



During the fiscal year 1974 the Gallery had over 1,263,690 

 visitors. 



A number of important works of art were acquired. Of particular 

 note were the paintings: Paul Cezanne's Houses in Provence and 

 Paul Gauguin's Te Pape Nave Nave, gifts of Mr. and Mrs. Paul 

 Mellon, The year was also noteworthy because of the acquisition 

 of numerous and important sculptures including Pietro Tacca's The 

 Pistoia Crucifix, Antonio Canova's Hercules Slaying Lichas, two 

 works by Foggini: Bacchus and Ariadne and Venus and Cupid, and 

 two highly significant twentieth-century works: Wilhelm Lehm- 

 bruck's Seated Man and Alberto Giacometti's The Invisible Object. 



In the graphic arts the Gallery added 96 drawings, 306 etchings 

 and 2,057 prints to its collections, with many outstanding works, 

 spanning six centuries from The Adoration of the Magi by the 



273 




Master E S, to a comprehensive collection of the works of M. C. 

 Escher. 



Notable exhibitions held at the Gallery included: "Etchings by 

 Rembrandt" and "Prints of the Italian Renaissance" (both continued 

 from fiscal year 1973). "American Impressionist Painting," "Six- 

 teenth Century Italian Drawings from the Collection of Janos 

 Scholz/' "American Art at Mid-Century I," "Francois Boucher in 

 North American Collections: 100 Drawings/' "Nineteenth-Century 

 Sculpture" and "Recent Acquisitions and Promised Gifts: Sculpture, 

 Drawings, Prints." A particularly innovative major exhibition was 

 opened in May 1974, "African Art and Motion," which through the 

 objects shown, video tape and recordings of ceremonial African 

 dancers and music, presented an integrated experience in the culture 

 of sixteen African countries. 



The Gallery's multimedia education program. Art and Man, pub- 

 lished in cooperation with Scholastic Magazines, Inc., reached 4,000 

 classrooms in every state of the country. 



The total number of bookings of Extension Service materials, 

 film strips, slide lectures, and films was 29,999. The total estimated 

 attendance covering all 50 states and many foreign countries and 

 United States military installations abroad was nearly five million. 



Total attendance at talks given by the Gallery's Education Depart- 

 ment and at the programs presented in the auditorium was 120,338. 

 These included the regularly scheduled auditorium lectures and 

 films, the Introduction to the Collection, the Tour of the Week, and 

 Painting of the Week. There were 35 guest lecturers including the 

 twenty-third annual A. W. Mellon Lecture in the Fine Arts, Pro- 

 fessor H. W. Janson, who gave a series of six lectures entitled 

 "Nineteenth-Century Sculpture Reconsidered"; and A. B. de Vries, 

 Director Emeritus of the Mauritshuis (Royal Gallery of Paintings), 

 the Kress Professor in Residence. 



The newly recruited Conservation Department, working without 

 the benefit of the expanded laboratory facilities still in the planning 

 stage, concentrated on a survey of the Gallery's Northern European 

 paintings with particular attention to those of Vermeer. 



The Gallery's art research project at Carnegie-Mellon University 

 in Pittsburgh neared its twenty-fifth anniversary and continued its 

 work in nuclear methods of analysis and mass spectroscopy. Under

a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, matched by 

 private donors, a three-year project was launched to produce a 

 series of handbooks on the characterization and analysis of artists' 

 pigments' sources and ages. Both projects are under the direction 

 of Dr. Robert M. Feller. 



In contrast to the previous year (1973), which saw much activity 

 in terms of new staff, new acquisitions, and new procedures, the 

 Library this year concentrated on stock-taking, classification and 

 reclassification, inventory, and reorganization. The complete inven- 

 tory is the first to be undertaken in the Library's thirty-three-year 

 history. A total of 3,973 books and pamphlets were added to the 

 collection, 2,070 purchased, 1,195 received as gifts, and 708 obtained 

 via exchange; 74,128 new photographs were added to the Photo- 

 graphic Archives. 



During the year the Gallery produced three exhibition catalogues 

 on the Sixteenth Century Italian Drawings from the Collection of 

 Janos Scholz, Frangois Boucher in North American Collections: 100 

 Drawings, and Recent Acquisitions: Sculpture, Drawings, Prints. 

 As an alternative to a catalogue for the "American Art at Mid- 

 Century I" exhibition, a portfolio of thirty-three, 8" x lO" full-color : 

 reproductions with text was produced — a first for the National i 

 Gallery. Two posters were also produced for sale. Continued public 

 interest in the Gallery's reproductions, postcards, and art books was ] 

 evidenced by the patronage of 292,883 people in person and 8,736 

 by mail. i 



The Concert Programs continued with 40 Sunday evening con- 

 certs in the East Garden Court which were well attended and also 

 broadcast live on a local am-fm station. 



The past year has seen the dramatic thrust of the East Building 

 from the ground to levels ranging from the third to the sixth floor. 

 In May the first exterior marble was set. Occupation and opening 

 exhibits are planned for the summer of 1977. 



Substantial progress was also made on the "Connecting Link" 

 area between the East and West Buildings. A radically revised plaza 

 design was developed, with glass tetrahedrons forming architectural 

 sculpture on the plaza and 'serving as skylights for the concourse 

 level below. This portion of the work, including an enlarged cafe- 

 teria, will be open to the public in the summer of 1976.

Smithsonian Year • 1974 



JOHN F. KENNEDY CENTER 

 FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS 



ROGER L. STEVENS, CHAIRMAN 



Faced with the perennial challenge of surpassing previous efforts, 

 the Kennedy Center opened its third season with an unprecedented 

 four-week festival: Shakespeare and the Performing Arts. In keep- 

 ing with basic philosophy that Center festivals must make an artistic 

 statement of unique importance, the month-long celebration was 

 designed to illustrate Shakespeare's profound influence on all as- 

 pects of the performing arts. 



Utilizing virtually every part of the building, the festival included 

 drama, dance, opera, symphony and chamber concerts, jazz, and 

 film. The Center's unique structure, with four theaters under one 

 roof, provided an extraordinary opportunity for comparative study, 

 as, for example, Macbeth was presented in its traditional dramatic 

 form in the Eisenhower Theater, while Verdi's operatic adaptation 

 was simultaneously staged in the Opera House, and two different 

 film interpretations were offered in the American Film Institute 

 Theater. Similarly, readings from Shakespeare were coupled with 

 stunning ballet passages they have inspired. 



During a special opening salute, activity extended even beyond 

 the walls of the Center, as Handel's Water Music was performed 

 antiphonally by musicians on the river terrace and on a barge afloat 

 the Potomac. 



Participating in the festival were such outstanding performers 

 as Dame Peggy Ashcrof t. Sir Michael Redgrave, Maurice Evans, Zoe 

 Caldwell, Christopher Plummer, Charlton Heston, Natalia Maka- 

 rova, and Cleo Laine. 



279 




The artistic and popular success of the festival opening carried 

 over and remained constant throughout the season that followed. 

 Audience support surpassed all previous years as over 1.7 million 

 people attended performances, and the vitality of the performing 

 arts in Washington was graphically illustrated by the fact that the 

 Opera House was in full operation for 50 weeks, the Eisenhower 

 Theater for 52 weeks, and the Concert Hall for 52 weeks. 



The season ultimately included: 125 performances of dance, by 

 distinguished companies from around the world; 160 symphony 

 concerts, including 129 by the resident National Symphony Orches- 

 tra; 42 performances of 15 operas; 37 recitals; 30 chamber concerts; 

 23 choral concerts; 44 concerts of popular music, folk, jazz, and 

 rock; and 671 performances of drama and musical comedy. 



In an expanded schedule, the Opera Society of Washington pre- 

 sented a total of five productions, including the American premiere 

 of Monteverdi's // Ritorno D'Ulisse, and the New York City Opera's 

 annual spring visit featured peformances of seven different works. 



In addition to return engagements of the American Ballet Theatre 

 and the National Ballet, the Center welcomed for the first time the 

 New York City Ballet and Britain's Royal Ballet. 



Theatrical highlights included a standing-room-only, post-Broad- , 

 way engagement of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, 

 with Lois Nettleton and Alan Feinstein; shattering performances by 

 Colleen Dewhurst and Jason Robards in Eugene O'Neill's A Moon 

 for the Misbegotten, directed by Tony Award-winner Jose Quintero; 

 Deborah Kerr's recreation of her London triumph in Frank Harvey's 

 The Day After the Fair; David Turner's The Prodigal Daughter, 

 starring Wilfred Hyde-White; Kate Reid's moving performance in 

 Brian Friel's The Freedom of the City; Anthony Quayle's powerful 

 portrayal of a contemporary Russian writer in Henry Denker's 

 The Headhunters; the premiere of Erich Maria Remarque's Full 

 Circle, directed by Otto Preminger; and Samuel Taylor's delightful 

 comedy. Perfect Pitch, with Tammy Grimes and Jean-Pierre \ 

 Aumont. 



In a unique arrangement, and what is hoped will prove the first ' 

 of many such examples of mutual cooperation between the Center 

 and American colleges and universities, the entire cast of The Head- 

 hunters spent a week performing at the University of Tennessee, 

 prior to opening in Washington. During their stay in Knoxville, ' 



280 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




director-star Anthony Quayle and others associated with the pro- 

 duction conducted a series of seminars and workshops which were 

 open to the entire academic community. Of particular significance 

 was the fact that students and faculty of the drama department 

 were able to observe work on professional production, prior to its 

 opening in their theater. 



The most significant theatrical event of the season, and the Cen- 

 ter's most ambitious undertaking since the 1971 opening of Leonard 

 Bernstein's Mass, was the American premiere of Tom Stoppard's 

 Jumpers. In a dazzling display, Stoppard combined both physical 

 and philosophical gymnastics to produce one of the most literate 

 and entertaining plays the theater has witnessed in the past decade. 

 Directed by Peter Wood and starring Brian Bedford and Jill Clay- 

 burgh, Jumpers played the Eisenhower for an unprecedented eight 

 weeks and went on to a limited Broadway engagement. 



During the course of the season, the Center also presented a 

 delightful series of musicals — including revivals of two classics : 

 The Pajama Game, with Barbara McNair, Cab Calloway, and Hal 

 Linden, and Good News, with Alice Faye and John Payne — Stephen 

 Sondheim's award-winning A Little Night Music, and a highly 

 successful engagement of / Do! I Do!, starring Carol Burnett and 

 Rock Hudson. 



Of particular artistic importance was the presentation in May 

 of a three-week Mozart Festival, conceived and developed by the 

 Center's Music Director, Julius Rudel. A series of 44 performances, 

 14 of which were free, illustrated the full range of Mozart's genius 

 and featured both familiar works and lesser known, rarely per- 

 formed selections. Highlighting the festival was the American 

 premiere of a revised edition of the opera Idomeneo. 



In a special community outreach, festival programming included 

 a number of outstanding concerts at the Smithsonian and in area 

 churches, and in conjunction with the Center's activities, the Music 

 Critics Association conducted institutes dealing with Mozart authen- 

 ticity, special Mozart performance problems, and Mozart opera. 



The following month, in a dramatic three-century leap, the Cen- 

 ter played host to Art Now '74, a celebration of contemporary 

 American art and artists. Art Now, produced by the Artrend Foun- 

 dation, utilized the entire roof terrace level and focused primarily 

 upon performance and post-object art, stressing the most adven-

[turous of current art trends. Interdisciplinary in nature, it included 

 the visual arts, dance, music, video, film, theater, and works outside 

 the realm of conventional classification. 



j Throughout the year, the Center's vitally important educational 

 Irole expanded through the continued growth of the Alliance for Arts 

 Education (aae). The Alliance, a joint project of the Center and the 

 Office of Education, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 

 was established in 1973, to make the Center's programs, facilities, 

 and services more accessible to students as participants and per- 

 formers; to stimulate, at local, state, and regional levels, quality 

 jprograms in which all the arts are included as an integral part of 

 !the education of all students; and to establish the Center as a focal 

 point for strengthening the arts in education at all levels. 



With the support of representatives of the President's Advisory 

 Committee on the Arts, the Friends of the Kennedy Center, and 

 national, state, and local officials, the Alliance established com- 

 mittees in over 40 states. These state committees provide a forum 

 and a communication center for arts and education organizations 

 iworking to achieve the objectives of aae programs. In the fall 

 of 1973, a Center-hosted aae conference provided a unique oppor- 

 tunity for significant exchange between educators and arts adminis- 

 trators from all 50 states. 



As a part of an Alliance "showcase" series, several states pre- 

 sented outstanding representative educational programs at the 

 Center during the spring. These included an appearance of 

 the Golden Spike Youth Orchestra of Utah, a poets-in-the-schools 

 project from New York, an exhibition of photographs and poems by 

 Sioux Indian children of South Dakota, and a workshop on the arts 

 jfor the mentally retarded. A total of 17 showcase activities are 

 scheduled for the summer of 1974. 



The sixth annual American College Theatre Festival, presented 

 by the Center and the Smithsonian and produced by the American 

 Theatre Association, brought ten of the Nation's finest college 

 productions to the Eisenhower Theater during a two-week period 

 in April. As a part of a new play writing project, two original stu- 

 dent works were among the productions staged. 



In cooperation with the Music Educators National Conference, 

 the AAE is developing plans for an American University Music 

 Festival, to be similar in scope to the College Theatre Festival. 



Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts I 283 




In addition to its AAE-oriented activities, the Center welcomed 

 over 55,000 Washington-area school children to a series of special 

 performances sponsored by the wives of Cabinet members and 

 performing arts organizations within the city. 



The ongoing Special Ticket Program enabled over 135,000 people 

 to attend regular Center performances at half-price. The program, 

 which is available to students, the handicapped, retired people 

 living on fixed incomes, limited-income groups, and military per- 

 sonnel in grades E-1 through E-4, reflects the Center's concern 

 that its performances be accessible to all, regardless of economic 

 circumstances. 



Under the chairmanship of Mrs. J. Willard Marriott, the 121- 

 member President's Advisory Committee on the Arts continued to 

 advise and assist in Center activities. During the year, the Advisory 

 Committee was particularly active in fund-raising activities and 

 in the development of the Alliance for Arts Education. 



The Friends of the Kennedy Center, established as an auxiliary 

 organization in 1966, grew to include over 10,000 members from 

 all parts of the country. Volunteers from the Friends have gener- 

 ously contributed thousands of hours of time and effort, con- 

 ducting public tours, managing souvenir stands, and providing 

 hospitality and other services to Center operations and functions. 

 Working closely with the National Park Service, the Friends have 

 provided visitor services to over two million sightseers annually. 

 Activities of the Friends are directed by Mrs, Polk Guest, who has 

 served as chairman since 1967. 



Charged by Congress with responsibility for maintaining the 

 Center as a national memorial, the National Park Service has car- 

 ried out vital maintenance, security, and information functions. 

 The daily efforts of National Park Service personnel within the 

 building and throughout the 17-acre site add immeasurably to the 

 enjoyment of sightseers and theatergoers alike. 



During its three years of operation, the Center has housed com- 

 panies headed by universally recognized theatrical personalities as 

 well as little-known college ensembles. Plays, operas, and ballets 

 have been created and molded within its walls. As the fourth 

 season approaches, with concrete plans and ambitious goals reach- 

 ing well into the future, the Center and its role as a living memorial 

 continue to evolve. 



284 / Smithsonian Year 1974

 ter is administered separately by a 45-member Board of Trustees, 

 composed of 30 members appointed by the President to ten-year

Smithsonian Year '1974 



WOODROW WILSON 



INTERNATIONAL CENTER 



FOR SCHOLARS 



JAMES BILLINGTON, DIRECTOR 



Late in 1968, the Congress determined that the official national 

 memorial to the 28th President of the United States should be — 

 uniquely among monuments to heads of state anywhere in the 

 world so far as we are aware — a "living memorial." 



The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars seeks 

 to commemorate both the scholarly depth and the public concerns 

 of Wilson through a program of advanced research and communi- 

 cation between the world of ideas and the world of affairs. Center 

 activities and aims can be discussed in terms of the three basic 

 ingredients of higher learning in a democracy: people, ideas, and 

 communication — people who can think, ideas that matter, and 

 communication that gets through. 



PEOPLE 

 Finding and supporting the gifted individual to conduct research 

 on subjects of fundamental importance is the primary concern 

 of the Center. The majority of Center fellows are selected on the 

 basis of open competitions, which are held twice yearly. Last year 

 the program accommodated 48 fellows and 5 guest scholars from 

 14 countries. Since the Center commenced its activities three years 

 ago, it has welcomed 118 fellows from 27 countries for ranging 

 scholarly research, along with 34 shorter-term guest scholars. The 

 Center has had almost as many foreign as American fellows — 

 bringing them together in a small group of no more than 40 at any 



287 




given time. If the company and its perspective are global, the scale 

 is human and the enterprise hopefully humane. 



In its selection procedures the Center relies deeply on panels 

 whose composition reflects the fact that higher scholarship in 

 America is heavily concentrated in universities. Fellowships are 

 not, however, confined to academics and are not designed for the 

 perfection of narrow specialties or private languages. Any scholar 

 with a major project in view that can make fruitful use of the 

 rich resources of the Washington area is welcome to apply. Fellow- 

 ships are awarded by three broad divisional panels: Natural Re- 

 sources and Political Economy; Social Studies; and Historical and 

 Cultural Studies. 



IDEAS 



Since the Center is free from traditional academic calendars and 

 departmental structures and deals only in free, individual research, 

 the opportunities are rich for the imaginative and cross-disciplinary 

 scholar and for a creative mix of specialties and backgrounds. The 

 Center is attempting to encourage depth in its scholarship by focus- 

 ing on the historical, philosophical, and comparative dimensions 

 of questions that matter for civilization. 



Much of the work at the Center has taken place in special subject 

 areas within the broader scholarly divisions — research on pat- 

 terns of sustainable economic growth and on the law of the sea 

 and uses of the oceans within the division of natural resources 

 and political economy, and studies of problems of the international 

 order and the American system of government within the social 

 studies division. Two new special programs in the latter division 

 will bring (1) distinguished historians from abroad to work in 

 Washington on the American Revolution as a world event, and 

 (2) thoughtful practitioners from state and local governments in 

 the United States to write a series of studies on the problems and 

 prospects of the American federal system. 



While there are clusters of scholars with such common interests, 

 the unifying force within the Center is the common scholarly com- 

 mitment of fellows, guest s'cholars, and senior staff alike to what 

 Wilson himself once described as "the passionate search for dis- 

 passionate truth." 



288 / Smithsonian Year 1974 




COMMUNICATION 



Attempts to communicate between the world of ideas and the 

 world of public affairs arise from the commission to serve as a 

 "living memorial" to a President who bridged both worlds. The 

 Center has the opportunity to perform a kind of switchboard 

 function, making connections between the research materials of 

 the Washington area, people at the Center, and the public sector 

 in Washington. 



On the basis of past experience and present assets, the Center 

 has sought recently to encourage both broadened dialogue between 

 scholarship and the public sector and expanded use of the un- 

 matched scholarly resources of the Washington area. Evening dia- 

 logues, colloquia on work in progress, and occasional conferences 

 are sponsored by the Center as ways of communicating scholarship 

 within and beyond the Washington community — above and be- 

 yond the publishing of the scholarly writings undertaken and 

 produced by Center fellows.

APPENDIX 11. List of Donors to the Smithsonian Institution 

 in Fiscal Year 1974 



I 



The Board of Regents and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution 

 join with the entire staff in thanking all of our friends for their generous 

 financial support and for their gifts to the collections. If perchance any 

 donor has been omitted from the following lists, it is an inadvertence 

 and not intentional. Many gifts were received from anonymous donors. 



Our gratitude also goes out to the many capable and dedicated volun- 

 teers, who contribute so significantly each year to the Institution's pro- 

 grams, particularly in the areas of education and visitor orientation. The 

 1,120 volunteers have graciously contributed 105,000 hours of work; this 

 represents 77 man-years and can be valued at approximately $900,000.
